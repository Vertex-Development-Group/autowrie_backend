Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP\nBitcoin\nBitcoin price tops $87,000 for first time amid ‘Trump pump’\n\nPrice has more than doubled in a year as traders hope Trump will favour crypto when he returns to White House\n\nJasper Jolly\nMon 11 Nov 2024 21.07 GMT\nShare\n\nThe price of bitcoin has risen above $87,000 for the first time as it benefited from traders’ hopes that Donald Trump will favour cryptocurrencies when he returns to the White House.\n\nBitcoin reached a record high of $87,198, before slipping back slightly on Monday. The price has more than doubled from about $37,000 12 months ago.\n\nThe election has also affected traditional currency markets, individual stocks – most notably Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla – and broad US equity markets, as investors bet on deregulation and tax cuts from Trump.\n\nTrump has in the past called bitcoin a “scam against the dollar”, but he changed his tune on cryptocurrency during the US presidential election campaign, courting the crypto community and appearing at industry events. That has created an expectation of a relaxation of rules to make it easier for retail savers to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – although Trump has not specified any policies.\n\nTrump reportedly picks China critic Mike Waltz as national security adviser – as it happened\nRead more\n\nThe Trump trade has spread throughout the world’s markets since his victory became clear, with the dollar gaining in value as investors await a high-spending US government.\n\nThe dollar rose by 0.6% on Monday against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, with the euro dropping to its lowest since May. One euro bought less than $1.06 on Monday, compared with $1.12 at the end of September. The pound also fell by 0.4% against the dollar, to trade below $1.29, close to its lowest level since August.\n\nIn China investors are bracing for steep new tariffs. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped by 1.5% on Monday, which some investors said represented an underwhelming response to China’s economic stimulus programme, announced last week.\n\nWhile the debt swap programme, aimed at shoring up local government finances, was worth about 10tn yuan (£1.1tn), economists at Deutsche Bank said that it “disappointed market expectations as it lacked direct fiscal stimulus and targeted measures to improve the housing market”.\n\nPrices have also risen since the election for other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and dogecoin, a meme coin previously backed by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and owner of X who has become a vocal Trump supporter and whose wealth rose by $26.5bn shortly after the election result was confirmed.\n\nTesla’s share price rose by almost 9% as investors hoped for the government to let carmakers accelerate autonomous car technology. Dan Ives, a prominent tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he believed that the “Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years”.\n\nMusk is not the only crypto backer with Trump’s ear. Trump even went as far as giving his backing in September to a cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, run by his family, a move that could leave him open to criticisms over potential conflicts of interest if he moves to deregulate digital assets. His son, Donald Trump Jr, has said cryptocurrency offers an alternative to a banking system that he alleges is tilted against conservatives.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion\n\nSign up to Business Today\n\nFree daily newsletter\n\nGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning\n\nEnter your email address\nSign up\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The crypto exchange Coinbase has jumped by 40% since the election result, and its share price was up by another 20%. Microstrategy, a software company whose founder led huge purchases of bitcoin, was up 26%.\n\nMatt Simpson, a senior market analyst at City Index, described the moves on crypto markets as a “Trump pump” as traders bet that the president-elect will usher in a period of cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nThe price of bitcoin correlated to Trump’s vote share in opinion polls during the election campaign against the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. It was below $70,000 on election day last Tuesday, but has gained nearly a fifth in value since then. Some market watchers believe the price could top $100,000 this week.\n\nExplore more on these topics\nBitcoin\nCryptocurrencies\nDonald Trump\nUS economy\nEconomics\nE-commerce\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content",

24-hour trading volume of $118.43B. Over the last 24 hours, the price has increased by 5.64%. Bitcoin currently has a circulating supply of 19.78M and a market cap of $1.84T.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset that uses public-key cryptography to record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain – all done without the oversight of a central authority.\n\nThe Bitcoin network (with an upper-case “B”) was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto.” The network is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that uses a cryptocurrency called bitcoin (lower case “b”) to transfer value over the internet or act as a store of value like gold and silver.\n\nEach bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis (the smallest units of bitcoin), making individual bitcoin divisible up to eight decimal places. That means anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price\n\nBitcoin’s price is renowned for being highly volatile, but despite that, it has become the top performing asset of any class (including stocks, commodities and bonds) over the past decade – climbing a staggering 9,000,000% between 2010 and 2020.\n\nWhen the cryptocurrency was launched at the beginning of 2009, as Satoshi Nakamoto mined the bitcoin genesis block (the first-ever block on the Bitcoin blockchain), 50 BTC entered circulation at a price of $0.00.\n\nFifty bitcoin continued to enter circulation every block (created once every 10 minutes) until the first halving event took place in November 2012 (see below). Halvings refer to bitcoin’s issuance system, which was programmed into Bitcoin’s code by Satoshi Nakamoto. It essentially involves automatically halving the number of new BTC entering circulation every 210,000 blocks.\n\nIn February 2011, BTC’s price reached parity with the U.S dollar for the first time. The milestone encouraged new investors into the market, and over the next four months, bitcoin’s price in USD continued to rise – peaking at over $30.\n\nBy early 2013, the leading cryptocurrency had recovered from a prolonged bearish episode and rose above $1,000, albeit only briefly. But with the infamous Mt Gox hack, China announcing its first ban on crypto and other situations, it took a further four years for the BTC price to return to above $1,000 again. Once that level was passed, however, bitcoin’s price continued to surge dramatically throughout 2017 until BTC peaked at its previous long-standing all-time high of $19,850.\n\nOver 2018, the entire crypto market plunged into what is now known as the “crypto winter” – a yearlong bear market. It wasn’t until December 2020, when bitcoin returned to test the previous all-time high, that it eventually surpassed that historical level and rose a further 239% over the next 119 days to a new all-time high of $64,799.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nHow does Bitcoin work?\n\nWho created Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin’s energy consumption\n\nManagement\n\nFLASH HEADLINE\n22:37:27\n|\nAr\nCrypto Asset Managers Arca and Blocktower to Merge; No Terms (Release)\n21:08:51\n|\nBitwiseinvestments\nCrypto Fund Manager Bitwise Buys Ethereum Staking Provider Attestant for Undisclosed Amount (Release)\n20:44:52\nBitcoin Hits New Record of $92k, Higher by 6% over Past 24 Hours\n19:43:15\n|\nArchax\nBitget Reenters Uk in Compliance Agreement with Archax (Earlier)\n19:31:19\nBitcoin Re-Takes $90k Level\n19:07:34\n|\nPrnewswire\nBlackrock's Buidl Expands Beyond Ethereum to Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon\n19:01:29\nBlackrock Launches Buidl on Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism's Op Mainnet, and Polygon\n19:00:14\n|\nX\nCoinbase to List Pepe\n18:56:49\n|\nAboutrobinhood\nRobinhood Crypto Expands Offering with Solana, Pepe, Cardano, and Xrp for U.s.

    "content": "What is Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market. First introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin continues to the top cryptocurrency according to market capitalization. Bitcoin paved the way for many existing altcoins in the market and marked a pivotal moment for digital payment solutions.  \n  \nAs the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has come a long way in terms of its value. It achieved an all-time high crossing $89,000 in November, 2024.\n\nOne does not have to buy an entire bitcoin as bitcoins can be divided into small units called satoshis, named after the creator. A satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 bitcoin.\n  \nThere is no physical BTC token so Bitcoin operates as a digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are fully transparent and can’t be censored, providing a global, censorship-resistant medium for financial exchange. It’s a financial system backed by decentralized network of computers, known as ‘nodes’, instead of  centralized banking or governmental entity, thereby promoting ‘decentralization’.\n\nWhy Is the Bitcoin Price So Volatile?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been highly volatile since it started because of several factors. Firstly, the crypto market is smaller and not heavily traded like traditional markets, so big trades can make the price swing substantially. Secondly, Bitcoin's value depends on public sentiment and speculation, leading to short-term price changes. Media coverage, influential opinions, and regulatory developments create uncertainty, affecting demand and supply dynamics and contributing to price fluctuations.\n\nAnother key factor is Bitcoin's fixed supply. With only 21 million bitcoins ever to be minted, its scarcity can lead to dramatic price changes as demand varies. This is exacerbated by \"whales\" or large holders of Bitcoin, whose sizable transactions can sway the market considerably.\n\nWhen Was Bitcoin Created?\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital asset is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network and blockchain technology, allowing users to securely and anonymously send and receive transactions without intermediaries. Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, outlining the design and principles of the cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin transaction, which involved sending 10 bitcoins to a developer, took place on January 12, 2009. Since then, Bitcoin has gained traction as an alternative store of value and payment system, transforming the financial industry.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nBitcoin runs on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, making it possible for individuals to conduct transactions without intermediaries. Transactions are transparent and secure thanks to the underlying blockchain technology, which stores and verifies recorded transaction data. Miners validate transactions by solving complex mathematical problems with computational power. The first miner to find the solution receives a cryptocurrency reward, thus creating new bitcoins. Upon validation, the data is added to the existing blockchain, and it becomes a permanent record. Bitcoin provides an alternative way to transact that's transparent and secure, redefining traditional finance.\n\nWhen Is the Next Bitcoin Halving? \n\nThe fourth Bitcoin halving was completed on April 2024. It is difficult to predict the exact date of the next halving as it depends on the block height. Since halving happens every 210,000 blocks, the next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in 2028.\n\nBitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, where the rewards given to Bitcoin miners for mining blocks are cut in half. Following the halving in April 2024, the reward was cut down to 3.125 BTC per block. Halving was built into the Bitcoin protocol to maintain its value as a deflationary currency.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Halving Affect BTC’s Price?\n\nThe price movement following the fourth Bitcoin Halving hasn’t been dramatic so far. Analysts believe that the cryptocurrency market is much more mature today than in previous halvings. The current economic conditions could also be a reason for no volatile price movements. \n\nOther factors such as market sentiment, regulatory developments, and global events can also impact the price of Bitcoin. Follow our Bitcoin Halving Countdown to know how Bitcoin halving works. \n  \n Bitcoin can be purchased on Binance.

    "content": "What is Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market. First introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin continues to the top cryptocurrency according to market capitalization. Bitcoin paved the way for many existing altcoins in the market and marked a pivotal moment for digital payment solutions.  \n  \nAs the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has come a long way in terms of its value. It achieved an all-time high crossing $89,000 in November, 2024.\n\nOne does not have to buy an entire bitcoin as bitcoins can be divided into small units called satoshis, named after the creator. A satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 bitcoin.\n  \nThere is no physical BTC token so Bitcoin operates as a digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are fully transparent and can’t be censored, providing a global, censorship-resistant medium for financial exchange. It’s a financial system backed by decentralized network of computers, known as ‘nodes’, instead of  centralized banking or governmental entity, thereby promoting ‘decentralization’.\n\nWhy Is the Bitcoin Price So Volatile?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been highly volatile since it started because of several factors. Firstly, the crypto market is smaller and not heavily traded like traditional markets, so big trades can make the price swing substantially. Secondly, Bitcoin's value depends on public sentiment and speculation, leading to short-term price changes. Media coverage, influential opinions, and regulatory developments create uncertainty, affecting demand and supply dynamics and contributing to price fluctuations.\n\nAnother key factor is Bitcoin's fixed supply. With only 21 million bitcoins ever to be minted, its scarcity can lead to dramatic price changes as demand varies. This is exacerbated by \"whales\" or large holders of Bitcoin, whose sizable transactions can sway the market considerably.\n\nWhen Was Bitcoin Created?\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital asset is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network and blockchain technology, allowing users to securely and anonymously send and receive transactions without intermediaries. Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, outlining the design and principles of the cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin transaction, which involved sending 10 bitcoins to a developer, took place on January 12, 2009. Since then, Bitcoin has gained traction as an alternative store of value and payment system, transforming the financial industry.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nBitcoin runs on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, making it possible for individuals to conduct transactions without intermediaries. Transactions are transparent and secure thanks to the underlying blockchain technology, which stores and verifies recorded transaction data. Miners validate transactions by solving complex mathematical problems with computational power. The first miner to find the solution receives a cryptocurrency reward, thus creating new bitcoins. Upon validation, the data is added to the existing blockchain, and it becomes a permanent record. Bitcoin provides an alternative way to transact that's transparent and secure, redefining traditional finance.\n\nWhen Is the Next Bitcoin Halving? \n\nThe fourth Bitcoin halving was completed on April 2024. It is difficult to predict the exact date of the next halving as it depends on the block height. Since halving happens every 210,000 blocks, the next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in 2028.\n\nBitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, where the rewards given to Bitcoin miners for mining blocks are cut in half. Following the halving in April 2024, the reward was cut down to 3.125 BTC per block. Halving was built into the Bitcoin protocol to maintain its value as a deflationary currency.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Halving Affect BTC’s Price?\n\nThe price movement following the fourth Bitcoin Halving hasn’t been dramatic so far. Analysts believe that the cryptocurrency market is much more mature today than in previous halvings. The current economic conditions could also be a reason for no volatile price movements. \n\nOther factors such as market sentiment, regulatory developments, and global events can also impact the price of Bitcoin. Follow our Bitcoin Halving Countdown to know how Bitcoin halving works. \n  \n Bitcoin can be purchased on Binance. Bitcoin's price today is updated and available in real time on Binance. \n\nView More",

Personally, as I believe and as you can see from my previous updates, every update I provided has been accurate, and the market has moved accordingly. Now, next, I’ll tell you that BTC can pump again from 92 to 95. The reason for this is the 34 level. Remember, when people were waiting for retracement, the market liquidated them at that time, and the same scenario is building up now. Everyone is waiting for retracement, and if you look at the liquidation map, everyone’s liquidation is around the 95-96 area.🚀🚀🚀\n\nPersonally, I believe BTC can reach 95 again, after which we might see a dip of 5,000, which could bring it back to 88-85. My target is 95, so note down this price, and you can manage your trade accordingly. 😍\n#USInflationAboveTarget #MidNovemberMarket #DogecoinPriceSurge #SOLFutureRise #Write2Earn!\nBTC\n+5.51%\nRisk seeker\n2 hours ago\nStill alive, how to continue?

Trump during his campaign made a variety of promises regarding crypto, including the establishment of a \"strategic bitcoin stockpile\" and the fostering of growth in the U.S. bitcoin mining industry.\n\nThe two largest days of flows into the bitcoin ETFs on record have happened since election day last Tuesday, according to Farside Investors.\n1\n These ETFs saw inflows of nearly $2 billion this Monday and Tuesday alone.\n\nBlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has now crossed the $40 billion inflows threshold in the fastest time for any ETF on record (211 days) and is now larger than any other ETF launched in the past 10 years, according to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.\n2\n IBIT surpassed the size of BlackRock's iShares Gold Trust (IAU) just last week.\n\nActivity is also finally starting to pick up for the more recently approved spot ether ETFs, which saw about $431 in inflows on the first two days of this week, according to Farside Investors.\n3\n\n\n\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

    "content": "BUSINESS NEWS\n'Trump trade' returns for second week as bitcoin, Tesla, stocks surge\nThe returning president has promised a friendlier regulatory environment for businesses — and especially cryptocurrencies.\nThe Bitcoin 2021 Convention in Miami.Marco Bello / AFP - Getty Images file\nNov. 11, 2024, 7:00 PM GMT+5 / Updated Nov. 11, 2024, 11:46 PM GMT+5\nBy Rob Wile\n\nCryptocurrencies and stocks, including Tesla, rallied Monday, picking up where they left off last week in the wake of the President-elect Donald Trump's victory.\n\nThe price of bitcoin hit an all-time high of more than $88,000, a rally that started shortly after Trump was declared the winner of the election. That's up from $68,000 — a gain of 27% — just since last Tuesday, Election Day in the U.S.\n\nYear to date, the price of bitcoin has nearly doubled.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 44,000 for the first time after it rose another 300 points Monday. That followed a week when it set multiple all-time highs after the race was called for Trump.\n\nThe Dow represents more established firms like large banks, which themselves had another strong trading day as investors anticipated that a more favorable regulatory environment will lead to an increase in merger and acquisition activity. Such deals necessarily involve tapping big financial firms to execute.\n\nBut it wasn't just larger firms: The Russell 2000 index, which covers publicly traded companies with smaller valuations, hit its highest level since 2021, finishing the day up 1.5%.\n\n“Stock investors are ... thrilled by the regime change to a more pro-business administration promoting tax cuts and deregulation,” Ed Yardeni, a longtime market analyst, wrote in a note Monday.\n\nLeading stocks higher was Tesla, which climbed 9%. CEO Elon Musk is expected to play an influential role in Trump's second term.\n\nTesla shares have soared nearly 50% since Tuesday on the expectation that the electric car company will benefit from a more favorable regulatory and policy environment. The Destiny Tech100 Fund, a specialized investment vehicle that holds shares of Musk's SpaceX, has climbed 200% since Tuesday, CNBC reported.\n\nShares in private prisons firms also saw significant gains after Tom Homan, the former acting director of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, was named \"border czar.\" Geo Group's stock was up nearly 5% — and it has approximately doubled since Tuesday — while CoreCivic's climbed nearly 7%.\n\nRecommended\nGUNS IN AMERICA\nFuture of Alex Jones' Infowars in hands of bidders at bankruptcy auction\nECONOMY\nInflation ticked up as voters cast ballots, but price growth for many basics holds steady\n\nSome have heralded Trump’s election as an especially positive sign for the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He has promised to quash the aggressive stance taken by the current leadership of the Securities and Exchange Commission against cryptocurrency firms and products it has deemed potentially harmful to investors.\n\nTrump has also signaled interest in creating a strategic U.S. reserve of bitcoin and has many crypto-friendly advisers to his incoming administration, including Musk, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur who announced last week that he was incorporating bitcoin into his asset management service.\n\nInvestors may also be responding to fears that inflation will resurface under Trump after months of price increases' settling in at a more subdued pace. Some investors believe Trump's following through on some of his campaign proposals would ultimately lead to higher prices.\n\n\"The likelihood of a pickup in inflation just got even higher — tax cuts, the deportation of immigrants, and tariffs are all likely to push up spending, wages and the price of basic goods,\" Noelle Acheson, author of a newsletter covering cryptocurrency news, wrote this weekend. \"Leaving the political impact of that aside for a second (it could be harsh), it adds to the tailwinds propelling crypto and gold.\"\n\nOther assets in the cryptocurrency world have also been rallying. Shares in Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, were set to rise about 14% Monday. Robinhood, the app-based trading platform that allows for crypto trades, was also set to hit an all-time high.\n\nAnd Dogecoin, a \"meme\" cryptocurrency that has mostly become a vehicle for pure investor speculation, has soared more than 160% over the past month. \n\nRob Wile\n\nRob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com.\n\nJesse Pound, CNBC and Steve Kopack contributed.",

Claro, memes podem subir junto com o BTC e as alts, mas grandes ganhos, na maioria dos casos, só irão acontecer quando o que foi dito anteriormente acontecer. 🙏🚀\n\n⚠️ Isenção de responsabilidade: Esta publicação é apenas para fins informativos e não constitui conselho financeiro.

Personally, as I believe and as you can see from my previous updates, every update I provided has been accurate, and the market has moved accordingly. Now, next, I’ll tell you that BTC can pump again from 92 to 95. The reason for this is the 34 level. Remember, when people were waiting for retracement, the market liquidated them at that time, and the same scenario is building up now. Everyone is waiting for retracement, and if you look at the liquidation map, everyone’s liquidation is around the 95-96 area.🚀🚀🚀\n\nPersonally, I believe BTC can reach 95 again, after which we might see a dip of 5,000, which could bring it back to 88-85. My target is 95, so note down this price, and you can manage your trade accordingly. 😍\n#USInflationAboveTarget #MidNovemberMarket #DogecoinPriceSurge #SOLFutureRise #Write2Earn!\nBTC\n+5.51%\nRisk seeker\n2 hours ago\nStill alive, how to continue?

Be cautious.\n\nReason 4: Buy the Current Cycle Narratives\nLast cycle was about gaming and metaverse; this cycle is about AI and DeFi. Invest in narratives that drive the current market.\n\nBonus Tips:\n1. Diversify: Don't put all eggs in one basket.\n2. Follow liquidity maps.\n3.

But focus was now on just what his policies will entail for crypto, as well as the broader U.S. economic outlook.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed more than 5% to $90,250.0 by 09:53 ET (14:53 GMT). \n\nBitcoin soars as Trump rally continues\n\nBitcoin continued registering new highs as enthusiasm over Trump’s election win now appeared continued, with focus turning to more cues on his planned policies.\n\nTrump has vowed to make America the crypto capital of the world, and has even floated the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve. Crypto proponents expect this to result in a friendlier regulatory environment, lending Bitcoin more credibility as an investment vehicle. \n\nOn the economic front, Trump is widely expected to dole out more expansionary policies, which could potentially underpin inflation and interest rates in the long term. \n\nQ4 of 2024 could be 'one for the books' for Bitcoin, says Nexo founder\n\nCommenting on Bitcoin's latest surge, Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev said this isn't a \"typical rally\" but rather \"a movement underpinned by a serious shift in the market’s fundamentals and maturity.\"\n\n3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.\n\n\"Retail investors are surging in through newly accessible ETFs, and heavyweight players are eyeing Bitcoin as a viable reserve asset,\" Trenchev noted.\n\n\"The path to $100,000 will be defined by the tug-of-war between buy- and sell-side forces. With retail and institutional demand converging like never before, the final quarter of 2024 could shape up to be one for the books, catapulting Bitcoin to levels once thought beyond reach.\"\n\nTrenchev describes the current environment for Bitcoin as uncharted territory in terms of price discovery, with every rise and dip highlighting the delicate balance between supply and demand.\n\nHe believes that Bitcoin’s market cap could eventually surpass that of gold a decade from, potentially increasing tenfold from current levels, though he cautions that the journey will be far from smooth.\n\nIn 2022, Trenchev said he remains bullish on Bitcoin, maintaining his forecast that the cryptocurrency will reach $100,000.\n\n\"The more bearish the consensus gets, and this appears to be happening right now, the more bullish I personally get,\" he said at the time. \n\nDogecoin soars on Trump’s DOGE announcement \n\nDogecoin jumped 13% to $0.4289, bringing its weekly gains to more than 120%. \n\nThe token was initially hit with profit-taking after Trump confirmed that Musk and Ramaswamy will lead the DOGE agency. Trump said the agency will work outside the government and will aim to reduce bureaucracy, \"unnecessary regulations” and curb government spending. \n\nThe idea of DOGE was floated by Musk prior to the election and is seen as a reference to the meme token, although whether this will result in any actual, official use of the token remains unclear. \n\n3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads.\n\nMusk has been a proponent of the token on social media, which is largely tied to its price action.\n\nCrypto price today: Altcoins track Bitcoin gains\n\nBroader crypto prices fell tracking a pullback in Bitcoin.

Even people who have zero interest in the industry have heard its name. As the number one cryptocurrency, it enjoys unimaginably high prices (up to $73K), a lot of attention, and, of course, much scrutiny.\n\nBitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that was created back in 2009. It is a decentralized digital currency that uses blockchain technology to facilitate trustless peer-to-peer transactions. BTC utilizes a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which means it relies on Bitcoin miners to secure its network.\n\nIn recent years, Bitcoin has been one of the most popular assets for investment: not only can it be extremely profitable due to the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, but it is also very easy to invest in. All one needs to get Bitcoin is an Internet connection.\n\nBitcoin, alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency market, is known for its ability to overcome any challenges and have strong comebacks despite everyone writing it off. Various financial experts have been predicting that the Bitcoin bubble will pop “in the near future” every month without fail for the past eight or so years. And yet, the coin remains on top, and BTC investors enjoy high profits, patiently waiting for yet another meteoric BTC price rise.However, as the crypto industry evolves, introduces new coins, and expands its reach, some crypto enthusiasts are starting to doubt whether Bitcoin is still worth investing in.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4g1XFU8Gto\nWhat Affects the Value of Bitcoin?\n\nNumerous factors can influence Bitcoin’s price movements. Unlike many altcoins, Bitcoin often sets the trend for the cryptocurrency market, showing less dependency on the performance of other digital currencies. Nonetheless, Bitcoin remains sensitive to universal market influences such as shifts in interest rates or significant developments in the crypto sector, particularly those affecting major players like Ethereum or Shiba Inu. For example, when Ethereum announced The Merge phase of its transition to a proof-of-stake model, it also influenced the perception and value of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin, like any asset, is susceptible to news specifically about itself, the broader crypto exchanges, or blockchain advancements. For instance, crypto valuations generally surge with announcements of widespread adoption or innovative technological advancements. A prime example is when major corporations like Tesla, Microsoft, Starbucks, etc. announced they would start accepting Bitcoin as payment, leading to a sharp increase in its value. Conversely, any hint of uncertainty, like rumors of regulatory crackdowns, can influence the Bitcoin market, too, and swiftly reduce its value.\n\nMain factors influencing BTC price: demand & supply, regulatory and global economic news, etc.\n\nExternal, non-crypto news can also play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s price. A notable example was observed in the spring of 2020, when the global economic uncertainty due to the pandemic heated up interest in Bitcoin as a potential safe haven, boosting its price significantly. Therefore, keeping an eye on stock market trends can provide deeper insights into the current state of Bitcoin. \n\nAdditionally, environmental news, such as intense scrutiny over the energy consumption of mining operations, is another area that prospective or current Bitcoin investors should monitor closely, as it increasingly influences market dynamics.\n\nHistory of Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin’s price history is known to most crypto enthusiasts. From being ultimately nearly worthless, this coin has grown to become one of the biggest assets in the world. At its height, Bitcoin’s market cap was even higher than that of several established businesses. \n\nLet’s take a brief look at the Bitcoin price chart.\n\nUpon looking at this chart, one thing that immediately becomes apparent is that Bitcoin’s price cycles keep on shortening. Additionally, despite the coin regularly losing value, the average value of Bitcoin keeps increasing. This shows a positive trend for the future.\n\n“Will Bitcoin go back up?” is an evergreen question in the crypto market. The truth is, no matter how hard we study BTC price history and trends, we would not be able to predict this accurately. However, we can still consider these factors as well as today’s Bitcoin news to make a tentative prediction.\n\nBitcoin’s crypto market cap is still the highest in the industry, and it still has the most recognition. Its circulating supply is slowly approaching its total supply but there’s still a long way to go till we reach a point where there will be no new Bitcoins released.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin price history shows us that there’s still room for this asset to grow even if there is a bear market.\n\nPlease note that this does not constitute investment advice.\n\nWill Bitcoin Go Back Up?\n\nThe future trajectory of Bitcoin’s price is constantly under scrutiny, influenced by various macroeconomic factors and significant events within the cryptocurrency sector.\n\nIn 2024, Bitcoin has already experienced a notable surge, updating its all-time high to over $73,700.\n\nThis March also earned its place in the history books. The SEC’s green light for these spot Bitcoin ETFs represents a huge milestone for the crypto community, potentially broadening investor access and confidence.\n\nAnother key event was the Bitcoin block reward halving that occurred in April 2024. This event, often associated with previous price surges, suggests a bullish momentum could be underway.\n\nExperts within the industry are forecasting a new growth cycle in the crypto market, potentially peaking between 2024 and 2025. This expectation aligns with the four-year market cycle theory, which coincides with the last bull run in 2021.\n\nBitcoin’s 4 year market cycle and it’s 4 phases: accumulation, mark-up, distribution, mark-down.\n\nHowever, external factors such as global news and events could impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory.\n\nAn important forthcoming event is the 2024 presidential election, where Donald Trump’s potential re-election is viewed by some as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin’s value. The Trump administration could foster a favorable environment for Bitcoin and other digital assets through more relaxed regulations.\n\nYet, despite these optimistic developments, the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency market remain under examination. The growing introduction of crypto-related products contrasts with expert skepticism, often due to strict global regulations and public hesitance towards new technologies, largely stemming from misunderstandings or fears.\n\nBitcoin remains a straightforward digital currency by design; all the same its slow adaptation and reliance on the environmentally taxing proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm might hinder its appeal compared to more versatile cryptocurrency ecosystems.\n\nGiven these dynamics, the question persists: Can Bitcoin recover and surpass its previous highs? Its historical resilience indicates the potential for a rebound, with analysts remaining optimistic about its future price action. Observing Bitcoin’s performance, it’s evident that this cryptocurrency represents a significant financial technology with the capacity to influence the global economy. It promises considerable projected growth and continues to affirm its role as a pivotal global currency.\n\nHow High Will Bitcoin Go? Bitcoin Price Predictions by Experts\n\nDespite Bitcoin dropping below $70,000 after reaching a new all-time high, the current sentiment among investors remains generally bullish, indicating an optimistic outlook for future price increases.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital sees Bitcoin peaking at $170,000 within the next year, marking a significant uptick in the current cycle.\nTechnopedia has adjusted its outlook for Bitcoin in 2024, predicting a new all-time high (ATH) of $85,000, with potential lows around $38,000. They expect the average price to hover around $60,000, revising earlier predictions of a peak at $98,000 to a more conservative estimate.\nMicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor anticipates a “supply shock” from the Bitcoin halving, which he believes will drastically reduce the amount of Bitcoin available from miners and trigger a substantial price increase. Citing historical performance post-halving, he suggests a similar bullish trend could follow this recent event. \nhttps://twitter.com/saylor/status/1781395787424891242\nTim Draper of Draper Associates projects a rise to $250,000 by July, sharing a highly optimistic view.\nSimilarly, Marshall Beard, CEO of Gemini exchange, predicts a rally to $150,000 by the end of the year.\nTom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors also foresees a potential rise to $150,000 in the short term and even speculates that Bitcoin could escalate to $500,000 within 5 years.\nArk Invest’s Cathie Wood envisions Bitcoin reaching $1 million within the next five years, an ambitious projection that underscores her confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential.\nDigital Coin Price suggests an average price of $130,185.47 for 2024, with peaks potentially reaching $136,867.90, and anticipates a new high of $160,457.56 in 2025.\nConversely, more conservative views from sources like Wallet Investor anticipate a possible rise to $75,867.21 in 5 years.\n\nThese bullish predictions are underpinned by Bitcoin’s finite supply and independence from external economic factors. Its growing acceptance and technological advancements, despite the evolving regulatory landscapes, bolster its investment appeal.\n\nThe Bearish Scenario\n\nAt the time of writing, the cryptocurrency industry largely maintains a positive view on Bitcoin, making it challenging to find notable bearish projections. However, two primary concerns could negatively influence Bitcoin’s price.\n\nFirstly, Bitcoin’s substantial energy consumption continues to draw criticism, posing a potential threat to its market value. Secondly, the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws, presents significant challenges that trouble investors.\n\nIf Bitcoin’s price crashes, then the values of other cryptocurrencies are likely to follow suit.\n\nIs Bitcoin a Good Investment?\n\nRead also: What if I Invest $100 in Bitcoin Today?\n\nNo matter if it’s in a down- or uptrend, Bitcoin is almost always predicted to keep rising in the future. So, it can be a good investment. However, please DYOR and carefully consider the risks before investing in BTC or any other cryptocurrency.\n\nOur Bitcoin price prediction is rather conservative and does not take into account any random media hype or unexpected regulations that may happen in the near future — these factors are too unpredictable. However, if you’re considering investing in Bitcoin, you need to make sure you’re ready for its price to fluctuate wildly.\n\nBitcoin is less risky than other cryptocurrencies, but it is still fairly unstable and unpredictable in comparison to traditional investment avenues like the stock market.\n\nIs Bitcoin still safe to invest in?\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin carries serious risks due to its high volatility. It’s advisable only for those with a high risk tolerance, a stable financial foundation, and the capacity to absorb potential losses. Before investing, ensure you fully understand what you’re getting into and conduct thorough research.If you’re new to cryptocurrency, consider checking out our comprehensive guide on crypto investments for beginners.\n\nIs it too late to buy Bitcoin?\n\nHistory shows that it’s never too late to buy Bitcoin online. The Bitcoin price today is still lower than its ATH, which means it may rise and go for a full-scale bull run again in the future.\n\nFAQ\nWhy is Bitcoin going down?\n\nBitcoin’s recent decline can be linked to several factors at the heart of uncertainty in the crypto market.\n\nLower trading volumes have magnified the impact of large trades, leading to heightened volatility.\n\nAdditionally, economic concerns, such as those in China’s property sector, have reinforced the perception of Bitcoin as a risk-on asset, susceptible to broader economic downturns.\n\nSpecific events like the shutdown of Binance Connect and notable departures from crypto firms have also shaken investor confidence, further influencing market sentiment and contributing to price drops​.\n\nWhat will $100 of Bitcoin be worth in 2030?\n\nRight now, $100 would buy approximately 0.00153846 Bitcoin ($100 / $65,000). If the price of Bitcoin rises to $500,000 by 2030, your 0.00153846 Bitcoin would be worth $769.23 (0.00153846 x $500,000).\n\nHow much was 1 Bitcoin in 2010?\n\nIn 2010, Bitcoin was still in its infancy and experienced significant price fluctuations. Bitcoin’s price started the year 2010 at around a fraction of a cent. The exact price is hard to pinpoint because Bitcoin was not traded on any exchanges until later in the year. However, it was valued below $0.01 for the first few months.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin saw its first significant increase in 2010, reaching around $0.08 in July. The maximum price of the year was conquered on November 6, 2010, when Bitcoin hit approximately $0.50.\n\nWill Bitcoin reach 1 million?\n\nThere are some prominent figures in the financial and investment world who believe that Bitcoin could reach $1 million. Notably, Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has predicted that Bitcoin’s price could exceed $1 million by 2030. Her predictions hinge on various factors, including the increased adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value and the impact of technological and financial developments on its valuation​.\n\nThese optimistic forecasts reflect a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential, driven by its broadening and deepening integration into the financial systems and the broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles. However, as with any investment, there’s an inherent risk, and such high targets are based on very bullish market conditions and assumptions.\n\nIs Bitcoin a good investment? \n\nThe forecast for Bitcoin price is quite positive. It is expected that BTC price might meet a bull trend in the nearest future. We kindly remind you to always do your own research before investing in any asset. \n\nTo maximize investment potential, one should regularly monitor their wallet Bitcoin balance and transaction history for accuracy and signs of unauthorized activity.\n\nHow much will Bitcoin be worth in 2025?\n\nThe Bitcoin network is evolving at a swift pace. The forecast for Bitcoin in 2025 is largely optimistic. Analysts expect the average price of Bitcoin to fluctuate between a maximum of $121,440.85 and a minimum of $45,871.41.\n\nHow much will Bitcoin be worth in 2030?\n\nWith a conducive environment for growth, Bitcoin’s future looks promising. Predictions for 2030 are highly positive, with business analysts anticipating that Bitcoin could soar to a maximum price of $500,000.\n\nWill Bitcoin ever hit $100K? \n\nIn March 2024, Bitcoin’s price soared to a new all-time high of $73,800, a milestone that many view as the end of the crypto winter and the beginning of a promising new market cycle. With this resurgence, a wave of optimism has swept through analysts and investors alike, many of whom are now anticipating a powerful bull run by the end of 2024 and into early 2025. They predict that this momentum could propel Bitcoin’s price to even greater heights, potentially breaching the elusive $100,000 mark.For a deeper analysis of the factors influencing Bitcoin’s trajectory towards this milestone, as well as expert insights, refer to our detailed exploration in the article: When Will Bitcoin Hit $100,000?\n\nWill Bitcoin go back down to $10K? \n\nIt is possible. After all, the cryptocurrency market is incredibly volatile, and the question of crypto regulation remains uncertain. \n\nHow high can Bitcoin go in 10 years? \n\nIn 10 years, Bitcoin may reach $1,000,000 or even higher. As long as there are no threats to it in terms of competition and regulation, its finite supply and growing popularity should ensure that it keeps conquering new price highs.\n\nWhy can there only ever be 21 million Bitcoins? \n\nThe simple answer to this question is “because it was designed that way.”  Well, but why can’t this limit be extended? Among other things, BTC’s finite supply acts as a deflationary measure and is one of the reasons why Bitcoin’s price is as high as it is. As for why this exact figure was chosen, there are a few theories about it. One states that it’s because the total value of all physical money in the world when BTC was developed was equal to $21 trillion. As a result, if Bitcoin had been then to completely replace fiat, 1 BTC would have been worth $1M, and one satoshi — $0.01.\n\nIs Bitcoin a safe long-term investment? \n\nBitcoin is a relatively safe investment compared to other cryptocurrencies. However, it is still a high-risk, high-reward type of asset and should not be seen as a reliable long-term store of value.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that the contents of this article are not financial or investing advice.

Lots of BTC holders are trying to speculate on the price, that’s understandable. Just do your research, and don’t put all your money in Bitcoin or anything else. There many other profitable ways to earn.\n\nFor sure, a block reward decrease will affect the price of Bitcoin in 2020. My expectations – before halving, the price will drop for like 20%, and then it will rally up to all-time high 1-3 months after the halving.\n\nReply\nThomas Hasenstein\n20 January 2020 в 05:00\n\nJohn McAfee will have a very small snack when it comes time to pay his debt.\n\nReply\nJor Dan\n13 February 2020 в 12:56\n\nThanks for your bitcoin price prediction! I actually doubt there can be such a huge drop down when I watch the current bitcoin price dynamics. However, the bitcoin price may fall, this is true.\n\nReply\nSandisiwe Nelani\n2 January 2020 в 14:22\n\nSo 2017 and 2018 had the perfect effect for the jovial of Btc returns and 2019 surfaced safely from the loss of profit. Then 2020 will hinge where it matter and release the question at hand . the traders and demand have been supporting I read this report. Thank you.\n\nReply\nFabian Wa\n13 February 2020 в 13:46\n\nPeople who’re saying that BTC will hit $100k and more are totally gone mad. Of course, Bitcoin price after halving may skyrocket but such jump seems pretty impossible for me now. The most possible scenario is that Bitcoin price will increase steadily like LongForecast says.\n\nReply\nJosh\n13 February 2020 в 15:42\n\nI guess bitcoin price will pump in 2020 after the halving than slightly will go down and be calm till 2022-23. We should be ready, so hodl\n\nReply\nOrlando\n13 February 2020 в 16:40\n\nThanks for the detailed stats but I see no point such far-reaching bitcoin price predictions cause it is hard to say what the industry will look like even after several very next years…\n\nReply\nGucci Granma\n13 February 2020 в 21:39\n\nAccording to Bitcoin price history, the father of crypto will continually go up, but of course, it’ll still be a wavy process. I have no doubt ’bout btc price rise…while the last bitcoin isn’t mined people will invest… after that the end of supply and apocalypses)))\n\nReply\ntom phelan\n9 May 2020 в 03:28\n\nBitcoin has already moved passed 10K and then retraced to 9,800 or so. Now, where does it go? 20k by December 2020?\n\nReply\nLip\n4 November 2022 в 08:03\n\nBitcoin, for some reason, has ceased to inspire confidence. It has become a completely useless centralized cryptocurrency that can be regulated by anyone. It is better to pay attention to promising cryptocurrencies like Crypton, which cannot be regulated\n\nReply\nINVEX\n10 June 2023 в 13:13\n\nAccording to this prediction of the future of Bitcoin, which is more profitable to invest in digital currencies, gold or real estate?\n\nReply\nFrank\n27 October 2023 в 20:28\n\nYour predictions have been incredibly helpful to me!\n\nReply\nPatrick\n30 October 2023 в 18:30\n\nI highly recommend the service\n\nReply\nanon\n23 February 2024 в 06:12\n\nnice services though..\nvery nice, too nice…\n\nReply\nDownload Changelly mobile app on your iOS or Android device\nKnow how to write about complicated things in a simple manner?\nJoin Us\nExplore\nProducts\nCompany\nContacts\n\nBlog content producer —\nblog@changelly.com\n\n© Changelly 2015—2024\nget a 0% service fee\nInsights Included\nElevate your crypto knowledge with just one click!

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nBY  WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS\nUpdated 3:47 AM GMT+5, November 13, 2024\nShare\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump’s reelection last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency topped $89,000 for the first time, briefly peaking at $89,995 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin’s price oscillated throughout the day, but is still up more than 27% over the last week — standing at about $88,288 as of 5 p.m. ET.\n\nThat’s part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated “crypto-friendly” nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.\n\nStill, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nBack up. What is cryptocurrency again?\n\nCryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.\n\nIn basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority — meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution — and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money — but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.\n\nWhy are bitcoin and other crypto assets soaring now?\n\nA lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of last week’s election.\n\nTrump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year’s presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nCrypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.\n\n“Crypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,” Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being “crypto-friendly” and a potential shift in regulatory backing.\n\nBut even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.\n\nInflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, “have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,” Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.\n\nIn April, bitcoin also saw its fourth “halving” — a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. When that reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. And, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this “supply shock” can also help propel the price long term.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nCrypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value — which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.\n\nIn short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you’ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.\n\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.\n\nAt the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool — and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.\n\n“Investors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. “Because we’ve seen these wild swings in the past.”\n\nWhat about the climate impact?\n\nAssets like bitcoin are produced through a process called “mining,” which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.\n\nRecent research published by the United Nations University and Earth’s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin’s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).\n\nIn the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has “grown very rapidly over the last several years,” adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.\n\nEnvironmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.\n\n_________\n\nAP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report from London.\n\nWYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS\nGrantham-Philips is a business reporter who covers trending news for The Associated Press.
