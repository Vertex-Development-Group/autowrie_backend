    "content": "What is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, known for introducing smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), and decentralized applications (DApps). Since its launch in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has set to revolutionize the blockchain industry by enabling decentralized applications to run on a global network of nodes. Ethereum uses Ether (ETH) as its native currency, powering transactions and smart contracts.\n\nEthereum’s Core Utility and Ecosystem\n\nEthereum’s utility lies in its ability to support smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) across industries like finance, gaming, and supply chain. These DApps function autonomously without central authority. Ethereum is also the foundation for NFTs (non-fungible tokens), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and other DeFi protocols, making it a core component of the decentralized internet.\n\nEthereum enables the execution of smart contracts, providing a trustless environment for users to transact. Gas fees, paid in ETH, ensure the network's operations remain efficient. Every transaction or smart contract interaction requires gas, making ETH a critical asset in the blockchain economy. The Ethereum blockchain has grown into a comprehensive network for decentralized apps, NFTs, and more.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade?\n\nEthereum's Pectra upgrade marks a significant step in enhancing account abstraction, validator efficiency, and network performance. With features like increased validator stake limits, flexible staking withdrawals, and streamlined smart contract deployment, Pectra sets the stage for the next phase of scalability.\n\nKey Features of the Pectra Upgrade:\n Account Abstraction: Simplifying the user experience with abstracted accounts, making wallet management more intuitive.\n Validator Operations: Enhanced validator performance with flexible staking and better operational efficiency.\n Improved Data Handling: Incorporation of Verkle trees for efficient data storage and transaction processing.\n\nPectra introduces new technical standards that enhance both the security and functionality of the Ethereum network, preparing it for future upgrades. Learn more about Ethereum's upcoming Pectra Upgrade and how it will affect you as a user. \n\nEthereum’s Transition: From Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake\n\nEthereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with the Ethereum Merge in September 2022. This upgrade reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption by over 99%, as the network now relies on validators staking ETH to secure the blockchain instead of miners solving complex puzzles.\n\nWhat is the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade?\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghai upgrade followed the Merge, introducing key improvements like the ability for users to unstake their previously locked ETH on the Beacon Chain. This feature unlocked greater liquidity for stakers, making Ethereum staking more accessible and flexible.\n\nEthereum 2.0 Roadmap: What Comes Next?\n\nEthereum’s development roadmap includes several major upgrades designed to enhance scalability and performance:\n\nPhase 0 (Beacon Chain): Introduced PoS. \nPhase 1 (The Merge): Completed Ethereum’s shift to PoS.\nPhase 2 (Sharding): Expected between 2023 and 2024, sharding will reduce network congestion and improve scalability by enabling parallel processing of transactions.\n\nEthereum's native token, Ether (ETH), has several utilities within the Ethereum ecosystem. It is primarily used to pay transaction fees, known as gas fees, which incentivize validators to process transactions and secure the network.\n\nETH is available on Binance for purchase and trade. The live price of Ethereum (ETH) is updated and available in real time on Binance.\n\nView More"

It has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, and enables users to transact and communicate without the need for a central authority. In contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum is a general purpose blockchain that can be programmed for a wide range of tasks. It can be used for building apps and organizations, holding assets, and facilitating financial transactions while respecting user privacy and avoiding censorship. ETH, the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, is used to fuel and secure the network, serve as collateral for the creation of other tokens, and support the Ethereum financial system. It has value as a means of paying transaction fees and as a store of value or tool for decentralized finance. ETH has also gained recognition through initial coin offerings.\n\nEther price\n\nIn August 2014, Ethereum launched its native token, ether, through an initial coin offering (ICO). Some 50 million ETHs were sold at a price of $0.31 per coin, raising over $16 million for the project.\n\nUnlike many other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum’s cryptocurrency has an unbounded supply, meaning there is no limit to how many ether can enter circulation.\n\nAccording to the project’s official website, the annual inflation rate of ether is about 4.5%. Block rewards have been reduced two times since the first ever Ethereum block was mined. That block is known as the genesis block. The reductions in block rewards aren’t programmed into Ethereum’s code like Bitcoin’s halving events are. Instead, members of the community propose changes, called “Ethereum Improvement Proposals,” or EIPs, and the rest of the community votes on whether to include the proposals in updates to Ethereum’s software code. Here is a breakdown of ether’s issuance schedule to date.\n\nBlock 0 to Block 4,369,999: 5 ether\nBlock 4,370,000 to 7,280,000: 3 ether (changed via EIP-649)\nBlock 7,280,000 to now: 2 Ether (changed via EIP-1234)\n\nThe issuance rate is also affected by a feature known as the “difficulty bomb.” This refers to a mechanism that increases the difficulty of mining on the original Ethereum blockchain (prior to the transition to the proof-of-stake Ethereum 2.0 blockchain. See below).\n\nIncreasing mining difficulty lengthens the time it takes for miners to discover new blocks. That means less ether enters circulation in the form of block rewards, which in turn tapers overall issuance. This mechanism was activated, reset and delayed several times between 2017 and 2020, mainly because Ethereum developers needed more time to work on key updates ahead of the 2.0 upgrade.\n\nFrom ether’s official launch date in 2014 to March 2017, the token’s price remained rangebound between $0.70 and $21. It wasn’t until the 2017 bull crypto market started to pick up in May of that year that ETH price went above $100 for the first time. From there, ether skyrocketed to a peak of $414 in June 2017 before correcting. It took another five months for bullish momentum to regain strength. By that point, the entire crypto market was starting to experience huge buying pressure, which elevated almost every crypto token to new highs. By January 2018, ETH’s price peaked at $1,418 before it fell sharply.\n\nIt took about three years for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap (behind bitcoin) to retest its previous all-time high price. Between February and May 2021, eth’s price more than tripled to set a new all-time high of $4,379.\n\nHow Ethereum works\nHow staking works on Ethereum\nEther and gas\nSmart contracts\nEthereum token standards\nEthereum 2.0\nKey events and management\nFLASH HEADLINE\n20:36:31\nDouble-Digit Percentage Gains for Mstr, Smlr, Iren Lead Crypto-Related Stocks Higher\n20:35:22\nBitcoin Returns to $95k, up 2.2% Past 24 Hours; Ether Ahead 6.9%\n20:07:37\nU.s.

Its native coin, Ether, can be used for digital payments and functions as a software platform for creating and deploying immutable decentralized applications (DApps) or smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\nEthereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, second only to Bitcoin. Ethereum changed the cryptocurrency industry by introducing smart contract functionality to blockchain networks. Smart contracts allow users and developers to access emerging industries like decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the seemingly limitless possibilities of blockchain technology and smart contract functionality, Ethereum has produced several multi-billion dollar industries. These include DeFi, play-to-earn crypto gaming, and the wildly popular non-fungible token (NFT) industry. Today, the Ethereum blockchain is home to over 2,900 different projects and has processed over $11 trillion in value.\n\n\n\n\nLike stablecoins, including Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), Ethereum's native token, Ether, is used to pay transaction fees when completing transactions on the network. It's also a currency exchange for digital assets stored on the blockchain, like NFTs. Following the Ethereum Merge, ETH will be used to secure the network and produce new blocks.\n\n\n \n\nWhat sets Ethereum apart?\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum network is designed to serve as a global computer that anyone can use. It aims to give users complete control of their digital assets and allow them to access tools and services traditionally controlled by centralized entities.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, on the Ethereum blockchain, anyone can provide digital assets as collateral and take out an instant loan. In the traditional finance world, this process would be governed by the jurisdiction of a centralized company. With Ethereum, every aspect of this function is handled entirely by smart contracts on the blockchain. This removes the requirement for partial intermediaries.\n\n\n\n\nThe blockchain can also make any program censorship-resistant, robust, and less vulnerable to fraud by running and offering it on a distributed network of worldwide public nodes.\n\n\n\n\nIn the spirit of decentralized ownership, anyone can submit governance proposals that they believe can improve Ethereum for the collective good of the project. After a proposal is submitted, holders of the Ether token can vote on its outcome. By doing so, the Ethereum community is responsible for guiding developments to the network.\n\n\n \n\nHow does ETH work?\n\n\n\nWhen the Ethereum blockchain was initially launched in 2015, it employed a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. In this model, new ETH tokens were created and distributed to miners as rewards for producing new blocks and securing the network.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that high-powered computational hardware installations, called mining rigs, compete against each other to solve complex equations in the mining process. The first miner to solve the equation earns the right to lead the production of new blocks on the network and is rewarded with new tokens as an incentive. This is also the same model employed by the Bitcoin network.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain also has an account-based architecture. An Ethereum account is essentially an entity that holds an Ether balance and can initiate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. There are two types of Ethereum accounts.\n\n\n\n\nThe first is \"external accounts\", which users control and manage through their private keys. The second is \"contract accounts\", known as smart contracts, and it's governed by code. Both these accounts can hold, receive, and send ETH and other Ethereum tokens and interact with smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\nExternal accounts can initiate transactions with other external accounts and smart contracts. The smart contracts kick in only when interacting with external accounts or other smart contracts. They can only respond by triggering code (involving multiple actions), transferring tokens, or even creating new smart contracts.\n\n\n \n\nEthereum's technology\n\n\n\nUnlike Bitcoin, which uses a distributed ledger, Ethereum employs a distributed \"state machine.\" Ethereum's \"state\" at any given point is a large data structure incorporating accounts and balances and the \"machine's state\" at that time.\n\n\n\n\nIt also encompasses the ability to host and execute many low-level machine code. This \"state\" keeps changing from block to block, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) defines the rules for changing it.\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum network has a host of use cases, with the ability to create and deploy smart contracts being central to all of them. This functionality allows developers to produce various decentralized applications on the platform, including crypto wallets, decentralized exchanges (DEX), DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, play-to-earn games, and more.\n\n\n \n\nEthereum token standards\n\n\n\nEthereum’s token standards, like ERC-20 and ERC-721, have been extensively used to create fungible and non-fungible tokens, therefore contributing to various multi-billion-dollar projects. ERC-721 standard-based NFTs, in particular, pioneered the NFT industry, which had a global market cap of $75.89 billion as of May 2024.\n\n\n\n\nERC-1155 is a token standard on the Ethereum blockchain that allows for the creation of fungible (identical) and non-fungible (unique) tokens within the same contract. This makes it a more efficient and flexible solution for developers to create and manage multiple types of tokens simultaneously. Meanwhile, ERC-777 brought \"Hooks\" to the Ethereum network. Hooks is a function that bundles the action of sending tokens and notifying a contract into one message, improving the efficiency of smart contracts. ERC-777 is also backward-compatible with the ERC-20 standard, which helps extend the functionality of ERC-20.\n\n\n\n\nAny time users transfer ETH or Ethereum-based tokens or interact with any application hosted on the platform, they must pay ETH as gas fees. In the future, ETH will also be used for validation purposes on the new Proof of Stake (PoS) Ethereum blockchain, with active validators required to stake 32 ETH to qualify for the job.\n\n\n \n\nWhat's the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)?\n\n\n\nIntroduced in 2015, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the Ethereum blockchain's heart. EVM is the environment where all the Ethereum accounts and smart contracts reside. It's a computation engine — also known as a virtual machine — that functions like a decentralized computer housing millions of executable projects.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, EVM makes up the bedrock of Ethereum's complete operating structure. As a single entity, EVM is simultaneously maintained by thousands of interconnected computers (nodes) running an Ethereum client.\n\n\n \n\nWhat's the Ethereum Merge?\n\n\n\nAs Ethereum's demand grew, the network's core architecture also started showing signs of congestion, and the average gas fee per transaction rose significantly. Hence, one of the Ethereum blockchain's biggest challenges is its exorbitant gas fees at times of high network congestion. For example, in May 2021, the average cost for a basic transaction on the network was around $71.\n\n\n\n\nFormerly known as Ethereum 2.0, the Ethereum Merge is a multi-year event that gradually moves the Ethereum blockchain from its PoW to the PoS consensus mechanism. While the transition will not instantly solve the high gas fees problem, it will make Ethereum a more environmentally friendly and efficient blockchain network.\n\n\n\n\nIn the PoW system, Ethereum miners compete with each other, using expensive computational resources, to add new blocks to the chain and earn ETH rewards in return. In the PoS model, however, they'll no longer need to mine the blocks.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, they'll create and add new blocks when chosen to do so and validate others' blocks when not. To earn the right to become a validator, they must stake 32 ETH with the network. Furthermore, since there will be no competition between validators, they'll no longer require expensive and advanced hardware like mining rigs for the job.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Ethereum team has been planning this transition since 2016, it initiated the process with its PoS Beacon Chain launch on December 1, 2020.\n\n\n\n\nThis marked phase zero of a three-phase process that will see Ethereum transitioning from a singular PoW chain to a multi-chain PoS network. Below are these three phases and how they intend to transform Ethereum.\n\n\n \n\nPhase 0 (Beacon Chain)\n\n\n\nThis involved the launch of Beacon Chain, a PoS blockchain running parallel to the original PoW Ethereum mainnet. In addition, it laid the groundwork for future upgrades to Ethereum. As of writing, over 410,000 validators on Beacon Chain have staked over 13 million.\n\n\n \n\nPhase 1 (The Merge)\n\n\n\nExecuted on September 15, 2022, The Merge involved merging the Beacon Chain with the existing Ethereum blockchain, entirely replacing the latter's PoW model with the former's PoS system. Post Merge, the original Ethereum blockchain has become the new network's \"execution\" layer, while the Beacon Chain has become its \"Consensus\" layer.\n\n\n \n\nPhase 2 (Sharding)\n\n\n\nSharding was supposed to be the second and final phase of the Merge. The plan was to spread the network's load across 64 new shard chains. The current PoW Ethereum chain would have become one of the 64 shards, simplifying the process of running a mining node by reducing the data load. However, this plan was dropped from the roadmap due to the positive impact Layer-2 rollups have had on the network's scalability.\n\n\n\n\nInstead, Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-4844 — also known as Proto-Danksharding — was introduced on March 13, 2024 as part of the Dencun Upgrade. One of Ethereum's most significant developments to date, the Dencun Upgrade was designed to reduce transaction costs and improve overall data throughput on the network. Proto-Danksharding supports the scalability fixes brought by Ethereum's various Layer-2 solutions, making it an adequate replacement for the shard chains originally proposed for phase two of the Ethereum Merge. Meanwhile, the Dencun Upgrade also brought 'blobs' to the network as an additional solution to Ethereum's scalability limitations. Blobs are large data structures that allow transactions to be settled at Layer-2, streamlining the network's operations and supporting future scalability improvements.\n\n\n \n\nETH price and tokenomics\n\n\n\nIn July 2014, the Ethereum Foundation launched the ETH initial coin offering (ICO). During this public sale event, roughly 60 million ETH was distributed to buyers at an initial exchange rate of 2000 ETH to 1 BTC. At the time, the Ethereum price was at approximately $0.31. Ether tokens were distributed to buyers at the genesis block of the Ethereum network.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Ethereum mainnet was launched, the initial supply of ETH tokens was approximately 72 million. While most of these tokens were allocated to early supporters, 16.73 percent of the supply was distributed to the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n\n\n\nSince the genesis block of the Ethereum mainnet, roughly 48 million ETH has been added to the supply via token generation. New ETH tokens are generated and distributed to miners via block rewards, making Ethereum an inflationary cryptocurrency. While the EIP-1559 London Hard Fork update introduced some deflationary mechanics, these currently don't entirely offset the Ethereum inflation.\n\n\n\n\nEmissions of Ethereum block rewards have been steadily declining over time. When the network was launched, new Ether was produced at 5 ETH per block. These rewards were given to miners as an incentive for securing the network and validating transactions. In October 2017, as part of the EIP-649 proposal, this emission rate was reduced to 3 ETH per block.\n\n\n\n\nThe ETH price reached its all time high of $4,878.26 on November 10, 2021, at the tail end of a bull market. 2022 saw the arrival of a protracted bear market for crypto, which lead the Ethereum price from its all time high down as low as $1,049.23 before the end of June 2022. The Ethreum price recovered but remained volatile into and throughout 2023, until the closing months of the year brought positive sentiment and a fresh bull market, helped by the arrival of a Spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2024. Following the Spot Bitcoin ETF's approval, there was much speculation around the possibility of an imminent Spot Ethereum ETF, which helped fuel an ETH price rise to $3,890 in early March 2024.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Spot Ethereum ETF\n\n\n\nThe possibility of a fully approved spot Ethereum ETF took a major step forward on May 23, 2024 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved issuers' 19b-4 filings. This development followed a remarkable about-turn in the spot ETH ETF story, as many commentators were bearish on the possibility of approval during 2024. The green light on the 19b-4 filings is by no means the final hurdle. Next, the SEC must approve issuers' S-1 filings before funds can be openly offered to interested traders. It's unclear when this final approval will occur, but many expect the process to take weeks or months. \n\n\n\n\nInterest around a potentially sudden Spot ETH ETF approval brought additional volatility to ETH prices. Before the May 23 decision, the Ethereum price had already rallied by 25% in a 24-hour period during May 2024.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the founders\n\n\n\nThe idea of Ethereum was initially described through a whitepaper written by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013, when he was just 19 years old. Before conceptualizing Ethereum, Buterin was an experienced programmer and developer who'd previously founded the Bitcoin Magazine news site.\n\n\n\n\nButerin believed that blockchain technology could be leveraged to build decentralized protocols and applications free from the control of central bodies. Buterin was an avid player of World of Warcraft, a popular online game. After its creators removed his favorite spell from the game, Vitalik decided that no single entity should have complete control over an application, thus forming the conception of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n\n\n\nEthereum was officially announced in Miami, in January 2014, at the North American Bitcoin Conference. A group of eight individuals co-founded the project.\n\n\n\n\nRussian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin was the most significant contributor and remained so. Gavin Wood of Polkadot (DOT) was the first Chief Technology Officer of the Ethereum Foundation. He coded Ethereum's first technical implementation in C++ programming language and created Solidity, the de facto programming language for creating Ethereum smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\nToday, Solidity is considered the essential programming language for Ethereum applications and enjoys widespread usage on other blockchains that operate an EVM. In addition, Wood found his own alternative blockchain network Polkadot, which aims to remedy some of Ethereum's issues.\n\n\n\n\nAnother notable co-founder who is known for building other Layer 1 blockchains is Charles Hoskinson. Hoskinson eventually left the Ethereum project due to differences of opinion on the project's direction. However, he founded IOHK with Jeremy Wood, another early Ethereum colleague, and went on to develop the Cardano (ADA) blockchain.\n\nShow more\nLatest news about Ethereum (ETH)\nEthereum Layer-2 Teams Welcome Proposal to Overhaul Blockchain\nFar from making zero-knowledge rollups obsolete, the Beam Chain would make them work better, says Polygon. zkSync builder Matter Labs is also bullish.\nNov 22, 2024|CoinDesk\nCoinDesk 20 Performance Update: BCH Gains 13.1%, Leading Index Higher from Wednesday\nEthereum Classic was also among the top performers, gaining 9.4%.\nNov 21, 2024|CoinDesk\nSEC delays decision on Franklin Templeton Bitcoin & Ethereum index ETF\nThe SEC has delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposed Bitcoin and Ethereum index ETF....\nNov 21, 2024|Crypto Briefing\nLearn more about Ethereum (ETH)\nDiscover more on ETH\nDeveloper Stories 01 | Ethereum Foundation's Justin Drake & OKX Web3 Product Head Owen: The Impact of Ethereum 2.0\nEthereum is the world's largest chain in terms of TVL and loved by many buidlers around the world.

The Ethereum network is a decentralized virtual computer with a programming language that allows developers to create and run smart contracts. Smart contracts are computer programs that can automatically facilitate, verify, or enforce the terms of a contract entered into by human or computer counterparties. The distributed computational resources that the Ethereum network brings to bear on a smart contract are paid for in ether, its currency unit.\n\nIf bitcoin resembles “digital gold” (i.e., a store of value), then ether resembles “digital oil” that powers a decentralized, global computer.\n\nInvest in Ether when you spend.\n\nEarn crypto rewards on every purchase with The Gemini Credit Card.\n\nApply Now\nEther Blogs\n\nWeekly Market Update - Friday, August 25, 2023 - Crypto Prices Stabilize After Drop, Friend.tech Emerges on the Scene, Fed Chair Powell Speaks on the Economy\n\nTeam Gemini • 16 min read\n\nWeekly Market Update - Friday, August 18, 2023 - Crypto Prices Tumble, Spot Bitcoin ETF Launches in the EU, The Sandbox Completes $100 Million Token Unlock\n\nTeam Gemini • 14 min read\n\nSee more\n\nEther Cryptopedia articles\n\nLearning the Basics of Spot ETH ETFs\n\nCryptopedia Staff • 3 min read\n\nHow Are Bitcoin and Ethereum Different?\n\nCryptopedia Staff • 5 min read\n\nSee more\n\nEther links and resources\n\nThe whitepaper\n\nETH/USD Extends Torrid Upside Gains: Sally Ho's Technical Analysis 10 November 2021 ETH\n\nEther price converter\n\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is Ether? How is it different from Ethereum?\n\nEther or ETH is the digital asset token of the Ethereum network (similar to how bitcoin or BTC is the digital asset token of the Bitcoin network). All ETH balances and transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. The smallest subunit of ETH is the “wei,” which is named after Wei Dai, a computer engineer and cryptographer best known as creator of b-money and the developer of the Crypto++ library. One wei is equal to 10-18 ETH or one quintillionth of an ether (.000000000000000001 ETH). Ether can be bought and sold for fiat currency, e.g. ETH to USD and vice versa, or other digital currencies.\n\nHow do I buy Ether (ETH)?\n\nEther can be purchased on a cryptocurrency exchange and stored in a crypto wallet and custodian like Gemini.\n\nWhat Are Ethereum Layer 2 Tokens?\n\nThe Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is considered Turing-complete and computationally universal. It allows developers to build Dapps that run on the EVM and pay for computational resources in ether. The EVM also allows developers to build their own digital asset tokens or layer 2 tokens on top of the Ethereum network. A number of these layer 2 tokens use the ERC-20 standard for fungible tokens. Many of these ERC20 tokens were built during and contributed to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom of 2017. Other standards for layer 2 tokens have emerged such as the ERC-233 standard for fungible tokens and the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens (also known as NFTs or “nifties”). The Gemini dollar , a stablecoin issued and operated by Gemini, uses the ERC-233 standard, whereas the blockchain game Cryptokitties uses the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens.\n\nEther Supply – Does Ether have a Max Supply?\n\nEther is issued at a constant annual linear rate via the block mining process. This rate is 0.3 times the total amount of ether sold (~60 million ETH) during the ether presale in June 2014, which equals 18 million ETH. This means that 18 million ETH will be issued every year in perpetuity. This is in contrast to Bitcoin, which has a supply that is fixed at 21 million BTC. While the overall supply of Ethereum will continue to increase, the growth rate of its money supply will decrease over time because the amount of ether issued per year is fixed. Because the inflation rate of ether decreases every year, ether is considered a disinflationary digital asset.\n\nDoes Ethereum Mining still exist?\n\nNo. Ethereum mining is no longer necessary following “The Merge,” as the Ethereum blockchain network now uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) transaction validation method that doesn’t require mining for ether.\n\nPrior to “The Merge,” Ethereum had been using a proof-of-work (PoW) transaction validation method. This consensus mechanism both safeguarded the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain and required miners to run smart contracts during the mining process, which created a decentralized pool of computation resources that forms a decentralized, global computer. As a result, Ethereum mining created useful work beyond securing the Ethereum network.\n\nWhy did Ethereum transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS)?\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) is emerging as one of the most widely used blockchain consensus mechanisms in existence. PoS networks incentivize participants to stake native coins, like ether, in a network of validator nodes. Upon the close of a transaction block, validator nodes are eligible to be randomly chosen to validate block data, thus generating the subsequent block, and earning native coins as a reward. A robust nodal network offers increased network security, resiliency, and computational power. \n\nProof-of-Stake systems also generally enable validator nodes to contribute democratically in decentralized platform governance through voting on key updates and decisions. While still a recent innovation, PoS networks are already proving they can be faster and more scalable than Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, in addition to being more energy efficient.\n\nBitcoin vs. Ethereum – What are the Differences?\n\nDespite being the two most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are quite different from one another. As mentioned above, a common analogy used to compare Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoin is like gold and Ethereum is like oil or electricity.\n\nBitcoin is the oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. When looking at their overall utility, Bitcoin represents a store of value whereas Ethereum provides a decentralized payment network that offers wider possibilities like trading NFTs and creating smart contracts. Other cryptocurrencies are issued on the Ethereum network, and Ethereum is responsible for pioneering the field of decentralized finance.\n\nWhile Ethereum’s versatility is a plus, it also comes with some drawbacks including higher gas fees, which can be significant, particularly on smaller transactions.\n\nHowever, Ethereum transactions went through a major change when it comes to energy consumption. The “Merge,” a transition from using a proof-of-work (PoW) transaction validation method to a proof-of-stake (PoS) transaction validation method, is expected to reduce energy costs by 99%. Ethereum’s transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain (PoS) began in 2022, and continues into 2023. Bitcoin (BTC) is still using the PoW mechanism, causing a significantly higher carbon footprint than Ethereum moving forward.\n\nBitcoin has a capped supply vs. Ethereum which has a limitless supply.\n\nLearn more about Ether on Cryptopedia\n\nGo to cryptopedia\nRecent Ether (ETH) Price Data\n\nThe price of Ether has increased by 7.06% in the past 24 hours.

The native cryptocurrency-essentially computer programs-of the platform is called ether or ethereum. Ethereum is divisible to 18 decimal places. There is currently no hard cap on the total supply of ETH.\nRelated Lists\nTradable Crypto\nDisclaimer: Prices displayed are for informational purposes only.

You are able to trade ether every hour of the day since there are no opening and closing hours like on stock exchanges. As you can see in the graph above, the price is constantly fluctuating.\n\nWould you like to adjust the time frame? It’s very easy. When you click ‘All’ for example, you’ll be able to see the historic price movements for ether.\n\nThe price that is shown in the graph above is determined by taking the average of several international exchanges.\n\nBelow you can see the most important measures of the ethereum price over the past five years: the highest and the lowest price of each year.\n\nEthereum price\tLowest price\tDate\tHighest price\tDate\n2023\t€ 1.137\t01-01\t€ 2.190\t12-08\n2022\t€ 946,46\t07-03\t€ 3.327\t01-04\n2021\t€ 604,66\t01-01\t€ 4.192\t11-12\n2020\t€ 98,88\t13-03\t€ 612,10\t31-12\n2019\t€ 91,47\t30-01\t€ 296,59\t27-06\nHistory of Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum network originated in 2015, when the so-called Genesis block was mined. A Genesis block is the very first block of a new blockchain. On the Ethereum network, ether is the corresponding currency. The terms Ethereum and ether are often confused. When you read about ether in this article, we’re referring to the currency.\n\nSo what’s the difference between the protocols of Ethereum and Bitcoin? Bitcoin has been designed to function as a peer-to-peer payment system in which safety and decentralisation are key. Bitcoin is an alternative to the existing financial system of central banks, who can print money almost limitlessly.\n\nEthereum wasn’t really designed to be a payment system. It was created as a platform on which decentralised applications can be launched. This way, the network could potentially function as a 3.0 version of the internet as we are currently using it.\n\nAnother function of the Ethereum network, is running so-called smart contracts. A smart contract is a programmed contract, which is automatically executed when the terms and conditions are met. This offers endless possibilities, and a lot is expected from Ethereum in the years to come.\n\nSince ether is the currency used on the Ethereum network, the demand for ethers will rise as the network increases in popularity. A rising demand will generally lead to a higher price.\n\nAn overview of the ether price\n\nIn 2017, the price of ether increased enormously. On the 1st of January, 2017, ether was worth approximately 8 dollars, by December 31st, the value had increased to 723 dollars!\n\nSome milestones of ether’s price:\n\n22 July 2014: ether is introduced with a crowd sale. One of the inventors is prodigy Vitalik Buterin. The introductory price is 0.26 euros.\n12 May 2016: ether's total market value passes one billion dollars, or 837 million euros.\n13 June 2016: 46 million euros worth of ether is stolen from the DAO, one of the first major projects on the Ethereum network. The scare is well underway and ether loses almost third of its value.\n5 May 2017: almost two years after launch, ether passes the $100 (84 euro) mark. A rise of over 32,000%\n13 January 2018: ether hits 2018 high of 1,500 euros.\n7 December 2018: the bear market hit ether hard. In December, the counter was as low as 70.80 euros.\n26 June 2019: the following year ether shoots to a high of 312 euros.\n13 March 2020: the corona crisis hits ether hard, the price falls to 80 euros.\nLate March 2021: in hindsight, this was the best date for the later entrant. Ether shoots through 1,500 euros and continues to rise.\nAdd more than double for a new ATH! On 12 May 2021, Ethereum reached another nice peak of 3,580 euros. \n11 December 2021: ether reaches a peak of 4,127 euros\nThen ether drops to a low of 1,022 euros in July 2022\nFrom then on, it very slowly started its way up again, reaching a price of 2,184 euros on 8 December 2023.\nWhat to expect from the ether price\n\nUnfortunately we can’t predict the future. The ether price is volatile, just like that of other cryptocurrencies. Daily price movements of multiple percentages are not uncommon.\n\nMedia reports can be of great influence on the price. Positive news about the use of the Ethereum network is generally well-received in the crypto community. This increases trust in the coin, which in turn positively influences its price.\n\nA good example is the formation of the Ethereum Alliance in March 2017. Members of the Alliance are prominent companies like Microsoft, Mastercard, ING, and Shell. By being part of the Alliance, they expressed their confidence in Ethereum. In turn, the price of ether went through the roof that month- it’s value almost tripled! Of course, it can’t be said for sure that the formation of the Ethereum Alliance was solely responsible for this increase, but it’s effect was evident.\n\nOnly invest an amount that you can afford to lose\n\nWe just keep repeating it. In our opinion, an investment in cryptocurrencies is one of the most interesting ones you can make, but equally risky due to its volatile behaviour.\n\nOne moment the price might soar, but the other it can suddenly plummet again. This is why we always recommend investing an amount of money that you can afford to lose, and to focus on the long term. In any case, we want to assist you in this great adventure and wish you the best of luck!\n\nLet today be your first day in the world of crypto.

What is the Token?\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a decentralised blockchain system with its cryptocurrency, Ether, enabling the execution of intelligent contracts and supporting numerous cryptocurrencies.\n\nConceptualised by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, Ethereum launched on July 30, 2015.\n\n2. Tokenomics\n\nEthereum has no maximum supply limit, contrasting Bitcoin's capped supply of 21 million coins.\n\nNew Ether is created through mining, and the EIP-1559 update introduced Ether burning with transaction fees, potentially making it deflationary during high network activity.\n\nInitial ETH distribution was 83.33% to Crowdsale participants and 16.68% to the Ethereum Foundation and early contributors.\n\n3. Market Data\n\nAs of today 27 November 2024, the price of Ethereum is ₹3,13,065.28 INR, with a 24-hour trading volume of 40820395612.42 USD. The market capitalisation for Ethereum is 428761887680.05USD. The circulating supply is 120435390.54 Ethereum, with the total supply also being 120435390.54 Ethereum.\n\n4. Token Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n\nEthereum enables the execution of smart contracts and capitalisation of decentralised applications (dApps), providing a versatile platform for developers.\n\nIt boasts a highly active development community, decentralised continuous innovation and improvements within the ecosystem.\n\nThe Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is aimed at enhancing the network's scalability and efficiency, addressing some of the platform's existing limitations.\n\nCons:\n\nEthereum experiences scalability issues that can lead to high gas fees during periods of peak usage, affecting transaction costs for users.\n\nNetwork congestion frequently occurs during high-demand periods, potentially slowing down transaction processing times and impacting user experience.\n\n5. Why Should You Invest in the Coin?\n\nInvesting in Ethereum is attractive due to its central role in the DeFi and NFT sectors, continuous development, including the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, and potential for expansion.\n\n6. USP of the Coin\n\nEthereum's USP lies in its support for smart contracts and dApps, establishing it as a key blockchain platform for a broad array of decentralised services.\n\n7. Problem the Coin is Solving\n\nEthereum expands beyond Bitcoin's capabilities by supporting smart contracts and decentralising a diverse range of decentralised applications and automation.\n\n8. Founder and Team Background\n\nIt was founded by Vitalik Buterin, a prominent programmer and centralised Bitcoin Magazine, with a vision for a platform supporting applications beyond Bitcoin's financial use cases.\n\n9. ICO Price\n\nThe Ethereum ICO 2014 raised about $18.3 million, selling ETH at an average price of $0.31. The substantial returns since the ICO highlight significant investment growth for early adopters.\n\n10. Risks Associated in Investing in the Coin\n\nInvesting in Ethereum entails risks like market volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and challenges related to the network's complexity and the Ethereum 2.0 transition.\n\n11. Whitepaper Insights\n\nEthereum's whitepaper, published by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, introduces Ethereum as a next-generation blockchain platform that extends the concept of blockchain beyond simple transactions to support complex contractual agreements and decentralised applications. The whitepaper outlines the technical foundation for Ethereum, including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which allows for the execution of code of arbitrary algorithmic complexity, and smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.\n\nThe whitepaper discusses the limitations of existing blockchain technologies at the time, particularly focusing on Bitcoin's limited scripting language. Ethereum aims to overcome these limitations by providing a more expressive and general framework that can facilitate a broader range of applications. This includes not only financial applications but also decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), decentralised file storage, identity and reputation systems, and more.\n\nEthereum's approach to consensus initially relied on a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism, similar to Bitcoin, but with plans to transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to improve scalability and reduce energy consumption. The whitepaper also addresses the economic model of Ethereum, detailing the issuance of Ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, as both a reward for securing the network and a \"fuel\" for executing smart contracts.\n\nThe whitepaper emphasises the importance of decentralisation and the potential of Ethereum to create a more secure, censorship-resistant, and efficient way to conduct online transactions and applications. It envisions a world where decentralised applications run on a blockchain can serve a wide variety of purposes, from simple peer-to-peer transactions to complex decentralised exchanges, without the need for intermediaries.\n\nIn summary, Ethereum's whitepaper lays the groundwork for a revolutionary platform that extends the utility of blockchain technology far beyond what was previously thought possible, aiming to create a decentralised internet where users have greater control over their data and online interactions.\n\nWant to invest in this coin?\n\nStart with as little as ₹100\n\nInvest Now\n\nReturns Calculator\nONE TIME\nRECURRING\n\nInvestment Amount\n\nInvestment Period\n\n6M\n\n1Y\n\n2Y\n\n3Y\n\nReturns\n\n₹177.27\n\n77.27%\n\nETH to INR Converter\n\nQuantity\n\nETH\n\nPrice\n\n₹\n\nINR\n\nPrice as per 10:33 PM • 27 Nov 2024\n\nPopular Cryptocurrencies\n\nHere are the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap\n\nBitcoin\nEthereum\nTether USDt\nSolana\nBNB\nXRP\nUSDC\nCardano\nAvalanche\nTRON\nStellar\nShiba Inu\nPolkadot\nChainlink\nBitcoin Cash\nSui\nPepe\nNEAR Protocol\nUniswap\nLitecoin\nRecently Added Cryptocurrencies\n\nIntroducing the newly added cryptocurrencies on Mudrex.\n\nUnilend\nLto Network\nHarvest Finance\nRequest\nQuickswap\nCoti\nDecentralised Information Asset\nSmooth Love Potion\nPopular Conversion Pairs\n\nA list of popular conversion pairs, including both fiat and cryptocurrencies.\n\nBNB\n\nto\n\nUSD\nBTC\n\nto\n\nINR\nXRP\n\nto\n\nUSD\nSOL\n\nto\n\nINR\nUSDT\n\nto\n\nUSD\nSHIB\n\nto\n\nINR\nLTC\n\nto\n\nUSD\nUSDT\n\nto\n\nDOGE\n\nTop Gainers\n\nCoin\n\n\t\n\nPrice\n\n\t\n\n24h Change\n\n\n\n\nSharky\n\nSHARK\n\n\t\n\n₹3.45\n\n\t\n\n74.19%\n\n\n\n\nPuffer\n\nPUFFER\n\n\t\n\n₹58.52\n\n\t\n\n72.55%\n\n\n\n\nROND\n\nROND\n\n\t\n\n₹0.11\n\n\t\n\n45.83%\n\n\n\n\nLista DAO\n\nLISTA\n\n\t\n\n₹54.28\n\n\t\n\n39.26%\n\n\n\n\nTelcoin\n\nTEL\n\n\t\n\n₹0.45\n\n\t\n\n35.77%\n\nTop Losers\n\nCoin\n\n\t\n\nPrice\n\n\t\n\n24h Change\n\n\n\n\nPRIMAL\n\nPRIMAL\n\n\t\n\n₹0.007093\n\n\t\n\n16.39%\n\n\n\n\nopenANX\n\nOAX\n\n\t\n\n₹8.03\n\n\t\n\n14.93%\n\n\n\n\nWeWay\n\nWWY\n\n\t\n\n₹0.09\n\n\t\n\n13.43%\n\n\n\n\nSui Name Service\n\nNS\n\n\t\n\n₹21.29\n\n\t\n\n14.4%\n\n\n\n\nPirate Nation\n\nPIRATE\n\n\t\n\n₹12.89\n\n\t\n\n14.62%\n\nHave a question not answered?\n\nYou can contact us at help@mudrex.com\n\nWhat is the price of Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nThe current price of Ethereum (ETH) in INR is ₹3,13,065.28 INR.\n\nWhat is the current ETH market cap?\n\nThe current market capitalization of Ethereum (ETH) is ₹3,77,31,04,61,15,844.40 INR.

thing that you would most likely want to do would be looking at live crypto prices. Why do so many traders and investors do that? Because the profitability of their investments depends on the price quotes in the first place. In the world of crypto markets, especially popular assets like ETH, there’s a lot of activity going on around the clock. That’s why if you look at the daily chart, or even squeeze the timeframe down to a few minutes of time, you might find that prices are constantly jumping around. So, naturally, some of you might think that buying or selling cryptocurrencies is not for the faint of heart. Have you ever tried to catch the best moment for making a transaction when the supply is big and demand is even bigger?\n\nETH price chart - what’s the deal?\n\nOf course, finding the right moment to act on your strategy might seem a difficult thing, but with a generous portion of your own research, you can do this. Then, the only step that’s left to do is to find a reliable place where you can exchange ETH to USD with the most favorable conditions.\n\nNow let’s talk about how the CEX.IO Spot Trading price chart might be useful for your daily trading and long-term holding. Say, you’ve decided to enter the crypto markets and after a thorough analysis, you found that it would be good to buy Ethereum. By the way, you can use ETH as a means of exchange for the already wide variety of decentralized apps, but we will talk about them in a moment. Right now, it’s important to understand what do you do in your first few steps after you’ve decided to engage in the crypto economy.\n\nWhy watching prices?\n\nIf you want to know whether you should or shouldn’t buy the token right now, check out its price history as well as today’s price movements on the chart. For example, the price of Ether means the correlation of 1 ETH to USD. In other words, how many US dollars you would pay to get one ETH token. Same works if you need to make an exchange from ETH to dollars. The prices may go up or down, and depending on your plans, both situations can turn out to be favorable for you.\n\nThe price charts like the one you see on this page are convenient for use whenever you want to check the crypto values. The visual representation of the market data allows you to understand certain trends as well as assess the upcoming events and see how they can impact the activity on the markets. As you can see, the information updates in real-time so this way you can be sure that you’re moving together with the present situation and not missing out on the shifts.\n\nIn case if you’re still wondering what is Ethereum (ETH)?\n\nMost people refer to Ethereum as cryptocurrency when there’s a slight difference between the organization itself and the native currency that they use for their own blockchain. So, to be clear, Ethereum is a blockchain platform, and Ether or ETH is its currency. ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin (BTC). And, with regard to the underlying technology, many traders find it even more interesting than the oldest Nakamoto’s coin.\n\nHow Ethereum is different from Bitcoin? The biggest selling point\n\nFirst things first, while Ethereum is, similarly to Bitcoin, associated with the anonymous public ledger, its founders are, unlike Satoshi, real people. The public face of the network is Canadian Vitalik Buterin. This guy has become one of the youngest crypto billionaires (born in 1994) thanks to his contribution to the world of so-called open finance.\n\nEthereum is quite different from Bitcoin because it was the first-ever blockchain network to offer something more than just a digital analog of money. The concept of Ethereum might be hard to understand for non-tech-savvy people but, in essence, it has really introduced a new global system of decentralized finance. This was on time in our age of the increased use of online products and services when the number of transactions has become so high that traditional services simply couldn’t handle such a load.\n\nAlthough many other networks these days offer the same thing with even wider adoption of the most common programming languages, Ethereum was the first one to introduce smart contracts. These are programs that have predetermined conditions and execute automatically on a blockchain.\n\nAlso, just like Bitcoin, Ethereum has started its operation with the help of a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, even though they had a different process of mining. However, it still consumed much electricity power which leaves a large carbon footprint. As a result, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 denotes the shift to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n\nEthereum facts - did you know?\nThere is an EEA (Enterprise Ethereum Alliance) that helps businesses to adopt Ethereum technology. Members of this organization include Fortune500 companies like Microsoft, JP Morgan, BNY Mellon, FedEx;\nThere is no supply cap for ETH - Ether can be issued without any upper limit of tokens, unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and many other crypto;\nMost Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are hosted on the Ethereum blockchain;\nIt does have a central authority — there is a core group of developers and managers who works on the network and promotes it. Also, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) although serves as a blockchain (which is kind of a thing in itself), in actuality it does have a physical structure in the form of thousands of computers all over the world. In all, it means that it does have tiny physical data centers, it’s just quite a lot of them.\n\nNow that you know all about the ETH in USD converter and know all about the cryptocurrency itself, let’s explore how you can easily convert Ethereum to USD.\n\nKeep calm and use CEX.IO Spot Trading or how to convert Ether to Dollar\n\nThere are a lot of things that you can do within the new decentralized finance system without pulling paper money in and out. However, you never know when you will need some hard cash asap in your real-life, tangible wallet. That’s why, you need to think in advance about quick, secure, and reliable methods of transferring your Ethers to dollars. Before you do that, as you already know, you need to check the ETH price and see if it will bring you the amount you expect to spend on your real-world matters.\n\nMost likely, it’s going to be an Ether to USD exchange rate but nevertheless, if you live in Europe, you may also check out the ETH to EUR rate. For British citizens, it’s better to choose the ETH to GBP for monitoring prices.\n\nNext, all you need to do is log into your CEX.IO account. Still don’t have it? It’s not a problem at all.

The table above accurately updates our ETH price in real time. The price of ETH is down -0.28% since last hour, up 7.06% since yesterday. The live market cap, measured by multiplying the number of coins by the current price is $429.55B. ETH has a circulating supply of 120.44M coins and a max supply of 120.44M ETH.\n\nABOUT ETHEREUM\nWhat is Ethereum?\n\nEthereum was the world's first smart contract-enabled blockchain, which essentially gave birth to 'Web3' as we know it today.\n\nWhile Ethereum’s roadmap and focus has changed a lot since its inception, strides have been made in both research and development that have helped ossify and clarify the direction Ethereum is headed. A previously heavy focus on sharding the execution layer has since shifted towards other scaling solutions, like Danksharding, for example. Today, researchers have bucketed Ethereum's roadmap into five major upgrades, each individually prioritizing one facet of the chain's mechanics to ensure future-proof sustainability:\n\nThe Merge for a robust and decentralized Proof of Stake consensus\nThe Surge for increasing throughput by many orders of magnitude through rollups\nThe Scourge for credibly neutral transaction inclusion and MEV management\nThe Verge  for reducing the resources needed to verify blocks\nThe Purge for simplifying the protocol and removing unnecessary costs and technical debt\nThe Splurge for everything else.\n\nEach of these upgrades will occur in parallel, with some receiving higher priority at different time periods given the needs and desires of Ethereum users and developers.\n\nAbout Ethereum (Ether)\n\nEthereum is an open-source, decentralized smart contract blockchain platform. It has its own native coin, ether, that trades with the ticker symbol ETH. Ether is also used as a gas asset within the Ethereum blockchain to pay for smart contract execution.\n\nEthereum was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian computer programmer, in a whitepaper back in 2013. At that time, the platform was unique because it was built to help expand the utility of cryptocurrencies by allowing for the programming of applications on a general-purpose blockchain via the use of its ERC-20 standard. This way, developers can build self-executing decentralized applications (DApps) by using smart contracts.\n\nAlthough Buterin is the face of the project, Ethereum has seven other co-founders. Gavin Wood, a British programmer, is the second most critical co-founder since he proposed the use of Solidity as Ethereum’s native programming language and was the first CTO of Ethereum’s Foundation. Other co-founders include Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the Ethereum project in its initial stages, Charles Hoskinson who established the Ethereum Foundation plus its legal framework, Mihai Alisie who assisted in creating the Ethereum Foundation, Joseph Lubin who funded the project in its early days and Amir Chetrit who helped develop Ethereum before stepping away.\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain was launched in 2015 by the Ethereum Foundation under the codename ‘Frontier’. Since then, the platform has undergone several network updates under different codenames. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Ethereum has an infinite supply. As of this writing, there are 122.7 million ETH in circulation.\n\nPrice History\n\nIn 2014, the Ethereum project raised over 31,500 BTC worth $18.3 million through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). At the time of the fundraising, ether’s price was $0.311, and more than 60 million ether were sold.\n\nBefore transitioning to PoS through an upgrade known as the Merge, the issuance rate of Ether was impacted by a feature referred to as the difficulty bomb. This is a mechanism that increased the mining difficulty, raising the time it took miners to discover new blocks. This, in turn, decreased the overall issuance of ether, especially between 2017 and 2020 as the mechanism was activated, reset, and delayed a couple of times ahead of the Merge.\n\nLooking back at the ether price chart from launch to March 2017, its price oscillated around $0.70 and $21. In 2017, the crypto bull market saw ether’s price rise beyond $100 for the first time. In June of the same year, the ether price shot up to $414. Five months later, the crypto market’s bullish streak strengthened due to increased buying pressure, pushing the price of every digital currency to new highs. Because almost every new project launched on Ethereum by doing an ICO, ether was in high demand. By January 2018, ether’s price shot to $1,418 before experiencing a huge fall. It would take another three years for its price to rise again to a new all-time high (ATH) of $4,379 between February and May 2021. On November 16, 2021, ETH hit yet another new ATH of 4,891.70.\n\nHowever, due to the 2022 crypto bear market, ether’s price has experienced a downturn in tandem with declining prices in the entire crypto market. For the remainder of the year, ether price predictions are estimated to be between $1,145 and $1,684.\n\nHow does Ethereum work?\n\nWhile the Bitcoin blockchain can be compared to a bank’s ledger, the Ethereum blockchain is similar to a (world) computer. Why? Because while it does document and secure transactions, it trades security for flexibility, and developers can utilize it to build a wide range of applications, so-called decentralized applications or dapps.\n\nSo, how does Ethereum work? Ethereum uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where validators secure the network and verify transactions. Validators must stake 32 ETH — or less when staking through pools such as Lido and Rocket Pool — to ensure they act in the network’s best interest. Dishonest behavior is penalized through something called slashing, meaning that the culprit loses a portion of their staked ETH. In exchange for their contribution to the network, validators earn rewards in ETH.\n\nFAQs\nDoes Ether have a future?\n\nBased on the fact that ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and it powers the Ethereum blockchain, one is tempted to assume that ether appears to have a future. Furthermore, Ethereum’s coin powers the NFT and DeFi spaces since most NFTs and DApps are built on the Ethereum blockchain, thereby needing ether as a gas asset to carry out their functionalities. For instance, Ethereum has the highest number of DeFi protocols, according to data from DeFi Llama. So will Ethereum be a great contender for smart contract applications going forward? It is hard to say with certainty what will happen in the future.\n\nIs Ether coin a good investment?\n\nYes and no. Cryptocurrencies are known to be highly volatile, which makes them risky investments. However, experts predict that the price of ETH will increase, and thus it may be a good investment opportunity. Still, should you choose to invest in ether, you need to do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.\n\nIs Ethereum a coin or a token?\n\nEthereum is a coin because it has its own native blockchain on which it operates and functions. Various tokens are launched on Ethereum itself.\n\nCan Ethereum reach $10,000?\n\nMany experts predict that Ethereum will not only reach $10,000 but will surpass it in the future as demand will continuously pick up. Ether could also become deflationary in the future, further pushing its price to new highs.\n\nRelated\nPopular Criticisms\n\nJust like any other technology, Ethereum isn’t immune to criticism. One popular critique focuses on Ethereum’s scalability issues. This is the inability of the blockchain to process as many transactions per second (TPS) as Visa or Mastercard. Ethereum’s all-time TPS lies between 1 and 16 compared to Visa’s 24,000 TPS and Mastercard’s 5,000 TPS. While Ethereum’s base layer blockchain is still limited in terms of scalability, second-layer solutions on top of Ethereum are already being developed to alleviate the issue.\n\nEthereum users have in the past protested against the high gas fees required to use the network, which can rise to hundreds of dollars. Also, the switch to PoS has led to validator centralization concerns. Based on this pre-Merge data, over 60% of staking was concentrated among a few staking platforms. Moreover, hours after the Merge occurred, Coinbase and Lido added more than 40% of the blocks to the network. Ethereum’s security could be compromised when a few entities control the majority of the staking market share.\n\nAnother concern is about Ether being considered a security by law. While there have been conflicting views coming from relevant entities, it is yet to be determined with clarity, if ether truly is a security in a financial context or not.\n\nComparisons to other Projects\n\nWhile the Ethereum network is popular in the DeFi and NFT spaces, Ethereum killers are building momentum and slowly but steadily growing their share in these spaces. Blockchains such as Arbitrum, Fantom, Tron, Avalanche, and BNB Chain are some of Ethereum’s top contenders. These blockchains are attracting user interest because they offer lower transaction fees and higher transaction throughputs than Ethereum.\n\nDevelopment Timelines\n\nEthereum has so far implemented two major upgrades: the Beacon Chain and the Merge. On December 1, 2020, the Beacon Chain upgrade took place, bringing staking to Ethereum. This was followed by the Merge on September 15, 2022, completely shifting Ethereum to a PoS blockchain and ending the era of Proof-of-work (PoW).\n\nBetween 2023 and 2024, the Ethereum network will undergo Sharding with a focus on something called danksharding. This upgrade will expand the network’s capacity to store data while working cohesively with layer 2 chains to reduce network fees and scale transaction throughputs.\n\nETHEREUM STATS\nWhat is the market cap of Ethereum?\n\nThe current market cap of Ethereum is $429.35B.

    "content": " \n✕\nNews\nMarkets\nTop\nGuides\nRecommended\nContact\n English\nADVERTISE\nSUBMIT A PR\nHome\n/\nNews\n/\nEthereum Price Today: Will This Sell Signal Trigger ETH Crash?\nEthereum Price Today: Will This Sell Signal Trigger ETH Crash?\nExplore if this sell signal will catalyze a crash in Ethereum price today or a bounce that pushes ETH to $4,000.\nBy Akash Girimath\n2 hours ago | Updated 58 minutes ago\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nEthereum price today hovers around $3,500, a critical hurdle.\nRejection at $3,500 could lead to a 17% correction to below $3,000 support level.\nA breakout above $3,500 could push ETH to revisit $4,000.\n\nDespite the recent Bitcoin crash, Ethereum (ETH) price trades today at $3,578.1 as of 4 PM. Surprisingly, ETH performance during the recent crash is much better than most altcoins, but this sell signal could cause issues and potentially trigger a crash for ETH. Regardless, Ether prices today hit a daily high of $3,576.8 after 7.16% move on November 27.\n\nWill Ethereum Price Today Crash Again?\n\nWhile many altcoins gave away gains to the market due to Bitcoin’s extended crash, Ethereum price remains steadfast, indicating strength. Depending on how BTC fares during Wednesday’s New York trading session, the value of ETH could drop lower or climb higher. As mentioned above, a sell signal flashes on the daily chart and could threaten the strength. Read more to find out.\n\nEthereum Price Chart Today\n\n*Ethereum price updated as of 4 PM.\n\nEthereum’s innovative smart contract technology has made it a standout altcoin since its inception in 2015. Continuous major network upgrades ensure Ethereum stays ahead in smart contract innovation. The latest upgrade, Cancun, launched on March 13, 2024.\n\nEthereum Price Outlook\n\nETH’s year-to-date (YTD) performance continues to increase and currently sits at 33%. This recent slump in Bitcoin price has affected the YTD gains, which have dropped from 50% since November 11. As of November 27, 2024, if you invested $10,000 in ETH on January 1, 2024, your portfolio, after 317 days, would be up roughly $3,317. Ethereum’s market capitalization stands at $430.8 billion.\n\nEthereum: The Second-Largest Crypto By Market Cap\n\nEthereum ranks second in market capitalization, valued at $430.8 billion, after Bitcoin’s $1.73 trillion. Together, BTC & ETH’s market capitalization constitutes 83% of the total crypto market cap.\n\nSince its all-time high of $571 billion in November 2021, Ethereum’s value decreased by half in October, but has spiked recently due to Bitcoin’s new ATH. Still, Ethereum maintains a strong lead over other popular cryptocurrencies:\nSolana (SOL): $98.8 billion\nRipple (XRP): $89.8 billion\nBNB (BNB): $91.0 billion\n\nDespite this recent downtick and recovery, the 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum is $45.1 billion.\n\nEthereum’s Crypto Trading Volume Soars\n\nThe 24-hour trading volume of Ethereum is $45.1 billion. Binance is the largest contributor to this trading volume – about 11% is contributed by spot trading and nearly 40% from futures trading. Exchanges like OKX, Bitget, and ByBit follow Binance.\n\nEthereum Upgrades to Proof-of-Stake Technology\n\nThe London hard fork is a significant Ethereum blockchain upgrade. It changed the network from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter). He explained how Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is more decentralized than Proof-of-Work (PoW).\n\nNotable Ethereum Blockchain Upgrades in 5 Years\n\nHere are some key upgrades in the past five years that shaped Ethereum as the second-largest crypto by market capitalization.\n\n2024:\n\nCancun-Deneb (“Dencun”): This upgrade aimed to improve Ethereum’s scalability, security, and usability, setting the stage for further enhancements.\n2023:\nShanghai-Capella (“Shapella”): Enabled the withdrawal of staked Ether (ETH), marking a significant milestone in Ethereum’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.\n2022:\nParis (The Merge): Successfully transitioned Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, reducing energy consumption and increasing security.\nBellatrix: Prepared the Ethereum network for The Merge by introducing the necessary PoS consensus logic.\nGray Glacier: Delayed the “difficulty bomb” that would have slowed down the network, ensuring a smooth transition to PoS.\n2021:\nArrow Glacier: Delayed the “difficulty bomb” again, providing more time for the transition to PoS.\nAltair: Introduced several improvements to the Beacon Chain, including better validator incentives and enhanced security.\nLondon: Implemented the highly anticipated EIP-1559, which reformed the transaction fee market, making it more efficient and user-friendly.\nBerlin: Introduced several protocol upgrades, including improved gas efficiency and enhanced security features.\n2020:\nBeacon Chain genesis: Launched the Beacon Chain, marking the beginning of Ethereum’s transition to PoS.\nStaking deposit contract deployed: Enabled users to deposit ETH and participate in the PoS consensus algorithm.\n\nMuir Glacier: Delayed the “difficulty bomb” to ensure a smooth transition to PoS.\n\nHow ETH Gas Affects Ethereum Price\n\nThe blockchain upgrades Ethereum receives aim to solve the trilemma of blockchain, i.e., balancing decentralization, security, and scalability. The switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) enhanced these aspects. Ethereum’s transaction fees (gas fees) plummeted post-upgrade, drawing more investors. Gas fees are like taxes, measured in Gwei, required for secure transactions.\n\nAs of November 27, the gas fee for a transaction on the ETH network as of 4 PM is 14 Gwei.\n\nWhen Ethereum’s on-chain value grows, presenting opportunities, investors flock, driving gas fees up. This typically occurs during market upswings, peaking at all-time highs.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast For Next 7 Days\nDATE\tPRICE\tCHANGE\nNovember 27, 2024\t3410.43\t2.79%\nNovember 28, 2024\t3403.94\t2.6%\nNovember 29, 2024\t3413.78\t2.89%\nNovember 30, 2024\t3435.93\t3.56%\nDecember 01, 2024\t3474.45\t4.72%\nDecember 02, 2024\t3482.86\t4.97%\nDecember 03, 2024\t3473.99\t4.71%\nDecember 04, 2024\t3485.11\t5.04%\nDecember 05, 2024\t3477.47\t4.81%\nDecember 06, 2024\t3468.89\t4.55%\nDecember 07, 2024\t3476.50\t4.78%\nDecember 08, 2024\t3474.76\t4.73%\nDecember 09, 2024\t3462.27\t4.35%\nDecember 10, 2024\t3444.43\t3.82%\nDecember 11, 2024\t3446.50\t3.88%\nDecember 12, 2024\t3432.37\t3.45%\nDecember 13, 2024\t3443.70\t3.79%\nDecember 14, 2024\t3463.18\t4.38%\nDecember 15, 2024\t3466.48\t4.48%\nDecember 16, 2024\t3469.00\t4.56%\nDecember 17, 2024\t3483.34\t4.99%\nDecember 18, 2024\t3525.58\t6.26%\nDecember 19, 2024\t3521.45\t6.14%\nDecember 20, 2024\t3530.18\t6.4%\nDecember 21, 2024\t3523.20\t6.19%\nDecember 22, 2024\t3501.58\t5.54%\nDecember 23, 2024\t3492.83\t5.28%\nDecember 24, 2024\t3490.18\t5.2%\nDecember 25, 2024\t3469.13\t4.56%\nDecember 26, 2024\t3494.83\t5.34%\n\nBased on CoinGagpe’s Ethereum price predictions, investors can expect ETH to trade at around $3,373 in the next week.

Based on the prediction data, ETH’s trade range extends from $3,001.19 to $4,651.84. This outlook is based on the previous data. However, if ETH breaks the trend, it could go much higher.\n\nThe long-term outlook extending from 2025 to 2029, Ethereum price could hit a high of $18,603 with the lowest point being $3,000.\n\nEthereum Price Forecast Between 2030 & 2050\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2040\n2050\nMONTH\tMINIMUM PRICE\tAVERAGE PRICE\tMAXIMUM PRICE\tPOTENTIAL ROI\nJanuary\t$16,092.58\t$16,559.25\t$19,264.08\t699%\nFebruary\t$16,757.17\t$17,253.50\t$19,925.17\t726.4%\nMarch\t$17,421.75\t$17,947.75\t$20,586.25\t753.8%\nApril\t$18,086.33\t$18,642\t$21,247.33\t781.3%\nMay\t$18,750.92\t$19,336.25\t$21,908.42\t808.7%\nJune\t$19,415.50\t$20,030.50\t$22,569.50\t836.1%\nJuly\t$20,080.08\t$20,724.75\t$23,230.58\t863.5%\nAugust\t$20,744.67\t$21,419\t$23,891.67\t890.9%\nSeptember\t$21,409.25\t$22,113.25\t$24,552.75\t918.4%\nOctober\t$22,073.83\t$22,807.50\t$25,213.83\t945.8%\nNovember\t$22,738.42\t$23,501.75\t$25,874.92\t973.2%\nDecember\t$23,403\t$24,196\t$26,536\t1000.6%\nAll Time\t$19,747.79\t$20,377.63\t$22,900.04\t849.8%\n\nBetween 2023 and 2050, Ethereum’s price will most likely follow the bullish outlook and aim for the six-digit territory. The lowest price point is $16,092.58, and the highest price of Ether is $145,915.83.\n\nETH’s Sell Signal Hints at Ethereum Price Crash\n\nThe daily Ethereum price chart shows a clear sell signal that hints at an incoming correction. This sell signal is in the form of a bearish divergence noted between the price and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). A bearish divergence is formed when price produces higher high while RSI produces lower highs, denoting a lack of momentum backing up the up trending price. The result of this non-conformity is a correction.\n\nConsidering that Ethereum price currently faces both the declining trend line and horizontal resistance level as a blockade, a short-term correction is likely. If Bitcoin drops, ETH could follow suit and trigger a 17% crash to $2,886. This key support level is a good place for accumulation before Ether triggers its next leg up.\n\nThe following bounce from $2,886 needs to overcome the $3,500 hurdle to climb to $4,000, a key psychological level.\n\nETH/USDT 1-day chart\n\nOn the other hand, if Bitcoin’s price fails to drop lower and trigger a reversal, then ETH will look stronger than other altcoins. It could break above $3,500 and preemptively catalyze a run to $4,000. This move will invalidate the short-term correction thesis.\n\nRECOMMENDED\nTRENDING\nCrypto Presale Projects For 2024 To Invest; Updated List\nBest Crypto Trading Bots List 2024; Updated List\nBest Crypto AI Trading Bots List 2024\nBest Crypto Exchanges and Apps September 2024\nTop Meme Coins to Buy Now: What You Need to Know\nTop 10 Web3 Games To Explore In 2024; Here List\nAkash Girimath\nAkash Girimath, an engineer by training, has developed a deep fascination with the complexities of cryptocurrency markets.
