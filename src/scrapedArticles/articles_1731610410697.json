    "content": "What is Bitcoin (BTC)?\n\nBitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the market. First introduced in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin continues to the top cryptocurrency according to market capitalization. Bitcoin paved the way for many existing altcoins in the market and marked a pivotal moment for digital payment solutions.  \n  \nAs the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has come a long way in terms of its value. It achieved an all-time high crossing $89,000 in November, 2024.\n\nOne does not have to buy an entire bitcoin as bitcoins can be divided into small units called satoshis, named after the creator. A satoshi is equivalent to 0.00000001 bitcoin.\n  \nThere is no physical BTC token so Bitcoin operates as a digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are fully transparent and can’t be censored, providing a global, censorship-resistant medium for financial exchange. It’s a financial system backed by decentralized network of computers, known as ‘nodes’, instead of  centralized banking or governmental entity, thereby promoting ‘decentralization’.\n\nWhy Is the Bitcoin Price So Volatile?\n\nThe price of Bitcoin has been highly volatile since it started because of several factors. Firstly, the crypto market is smaller and not heavily traded like traditional markets, so big trades can make the price swing substantially. Secondly, Bitcoin's value depends on public sentiment and speculation, leading to short-term price changes. Media coverage, influential opinions, and regulatory developments create uncertainty, affecting demand and supply dynamics and contributing to price fluctuations.\n\nAnother key factor is Bitcoin's fixed supply. With only 21 million bitcoins ever to be minted, its scarcity can lead to dramatic price changes as demand varies. This is exacerbated by \"whales\" or large holders of Bitcoin, whose sizable transactions can sway the market considerably.\n\nWhen Was Bitcoin Created?\n\nBitcoin was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The digital asset is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network and blockchain technology, allowing users to securely and anonymously send and receive transactions without intermediaries. Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, outlining the design and principles of the cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin transaction, which involved sending 10 bitcoins to a developer, took place on January 12, 2009. Since then, Bitcoin has gained traction as an alternative store of value and payment system, transforming the financial industry.\n\nHow Does Bitcoin Work?\n\nBitcoin runs on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, making it possible for individuals to conduct transactions without intermediaries. Transactions are transparent and secure thanks to the underlying blockchain technology, which stores and verifies recorded transaction data. Miners validate transactions by solving complex mathematical problems with computational power. The first miner to find the solution receives a cryptocurrency reward, thus creating new bitcoins. Upon validation, the data is added to the existing blockchain, and it becomes a permanent record. Bitcoin provides an alternative way to transact that's transparent and secure, redefining traditional finance.\n\nWhen Is the Next Bitcoin Halving? \n\nThe fourth Bitcoin halving was completed on April 2024. It is difficult to predict the exact date of the next halving as it depends on the block height. Since halving happens every 210,000 blocks, the next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in 2028.\n\nBitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years, where the rewards given to Bitcoin miners for mining blocks are cut in half. Following the halving in April 2024, the reward was cut down to 3.125 BTC per block. Halving was built into the Bitcoin protocol to maintain its value as a deflationary currency.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Halving Affect BTC’s Price?\n\nThe price movement following the fourth Bitcoin Halving hasn’t been dramatic so far. Analysts believe that the cryptocurrency market is much more mature today than in previous halvings. The current economic conditions could also be a reason for no volatile price movements. \n\nOther factors such as market sentiment, regulatory developments, and global events can also impact the price of Bitcoin. Follow our Bitcoin Halving Countdown to know how Bitcoin halving works. \n  \n Bitcoin can be purchased on Binance.

    "content": "As Bitcoin (BTC) trades near record highs in 2024, the cryptocurrency market watches with strong positive sentiment as BTC inches closer to the coveted $100,000 mark. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has seen dramatic price movements, but the current bull market suggests a six-figure price target is within reach. What is more, it can happen in the next few weeks.\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: From Bear Market to New All-Time High\n\nThe crypto industry has witnessed unprecedented growth, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $93,495 on Wednesday, according to Coinbase data. Contributing to Bitcoin's surge are multiple factors, including Trump's presidential victory and BlackRock's institutional involvement. The spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen record inflows, demonstrating growing interest from both retail investors and institutional investors.\n\nBitcoin has had an impressive run in 2024, gaining nearly 30% in recent weeks and surpassing $93,000. Analysts from various crypto and financial research firms have shared predictions on Bitcoin’s price for year-end and beyond, fueled by the recent rally and favorable economic conditions.\n\nBitcoin reached a new ATH on Wednesday. Source: Tradingview.com\n\nRyan Lee of Bitget Research believes the cryptocurrency’s November momentum could propel it past $100,000, citing historical patterns and post-halving cycle trends.\n\n“If history repeats itself, Bitcoin’s projected growth could take it well above $100,000 by month-end,” Lee remarked.\n\nExpert Analysis and Year-End Predictions\n\nMeanwhile, Bitfinex analysts attribute Bitcoin’s bullish momentum to Trump’s presidential victory and the potential for continued interest rate cuts in the U.S.\n\n“We expect Bitcoin to accumulate and range, with $100,000 in a few months,” they explained, adding that Trump's administration is likely to support pro-crypto policies, boosting cryptocurrency adoption among institutional investors.\n\nPrediction Markets and Analyst Views\n\nThe following table compiles various Bitcoin price forecasts from multiple analysts, highlighting their predictions and underlying rationales:\n\nAnalyst/Organization\n\n\t\n\nPredicted Price\n\n\t\n\nTimeframe\n\n\t\n\nKey Factors\n\n\n\n\nRyan Lee, Bitget Research\n\n\t\n\n$100,000+\n\n\t\n\nNovember 2024\n\n\t\n\nHistorical performance in November; post-halving cycle trends; increased investor demand post-election.\n\n\n\n\nBitfinex Analysts\n\n\t\n\n$100,000\n\n\t\n\nEarly 2025\n\n\t\n\nTrump's pro-crypto policies; avoidance of recession; anticipated U.S. interest rate cuts; Bitcoin's reduced supply post-halving.\n\n\n\n\nFadi Aboualfa, Copper.co\n\n\t\n\n$100,000\n\n\t\n\nBy January 20, 2025\n\n\t\n\nPro-crypto regulations under Trump; growing institutional demand via Bitcoin ETFs; potential U.S. dollar policy adjustments.\n\n\n\n\nLennix Lai, OKX\n\n\t\n\nBeyond $100,000\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nSignals of a paradigm shift in crypto growth; potential market euphoria; macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\n\n\n\nTony Sycamore, IG Markets\n\n\t\n\nLow to mid $90,000s\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nThe market already pricing in bullish catalysts; a potential shift of investments to altcoins.\n\n\n\n\nJosh Gilbert, eToro\n\n\t\n\n$100,000\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nTrump's election; cooling interest rates; robust U.S. economy; growing institutional appetite; potential short-term corrections.\n\n\n\n\nKi Young Ju, CryptoQuant\n\n\t\n\n$58,974\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nOverheated derivatives activity; potential for market correction and consolidation.\n\n\n\n\nPav Hundal, SwyftX\n\n\t\n\n$103,000\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nFibonacci extension analysis; strong market trend; potential for short-term pullbacks.\n\n\n\n\nGuy Armoni, HDI Fund\n\n\t\n\n$100,000\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nGrowing global crypto adoption; favorable U.S. policy environment; potential for extended bull market into 2025.\n\n\n\n\nMati Greenspan, Quantum Economics\n\n\t\n\nHigher than current levels\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nBitcoin's resilience; potential for a prolonged bull run; caution against short-term euphoria.\n\n\n\n\nBen Simpson, Collective Shift\n\n\t\n\n$100,000\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nTrump's election; declining interest rates; potential quantitative easing; significant Bitcoin ETF volumes; limited supply dynamics.\n\n\n\n\nTom Wan, Independent Analyst\n\n\t\n\n$80,000–$95,000\n\n\t\n\nBy the end of 2024\n\n\t\n\nAnticipation of pro-crypto regulations; significant Bitcoin ETF inflows; record open interest as a potential headwind.\n\nNote: These forecasts are based on analyses and opinions as of November 2024 and are subject to change with market dynamics.\n\nThe Role of Trump’s Election and Institutional Inflows in Bitcoin’s Surge\n\nTrump’s victory has created significant excitement in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts, including Fadi Aboualfa from Copper.co, argue that the election could set a supportive regulatory backdrop for Bitcoin.\n\nFadi Aboualfa from Copper.co\n\n“Trump’s win has provided market stability, helping institutional investors show renewed interest in Bitcoin,” Aboualfa said, noting that Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.6 billion in inflows within days of the election. Copper.co’s forecast suggests that spot Bitcoin ETFs could drive the price closer to the $100,000 level by early 2025.\n\nWith Bitcoin ETFs garnering interest from major institutions such as BlackRock, Pav Hundal from SwyftX sees an end-of-year target of $103,000.\n\n“If you apply a Fibonacci extension, Bitcoin could trade at $103,000 by year-end,” Hundal explained. Institutional inflows are likely to support higher price discovery, aligning with broader crypto adoption among investors and financial institutions.\n\nThe highest price = the highest market cap of Bitcoin. Source: CoinMarketCap.com\nBitcoin in 2024: Price Action and Market Dynamics\n\nWhile most analysts are bullish, others warn that volatility could pose challenges in the short term. Crypto.com’s CEO Kris Marszalek points out that Bitcoin’s leverage ratios have reached unsustainable levels.\n\nLeverage needs to be cleaned up before attack on $100k. Please manage your risk carefully.\n\n— Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) November 12, 2024\n\n“Leverage needs to be cleaned up before an attack on $100K. Please manage your risk carefully,” Marszalek cautioned, referring to Bitcoin’s high open interest across exchanges. Similarly, Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant predicts potential pullbacks, setting his price target for Bitcoin at $58,974, well below the year-end goal others envision.\n\nI expected corrections as BTC futures market indicators overheated, but we're entering price discovery, and the market is heating up even more.\n\nIf correction and consolidation occur, the bull run may extend; however, a strong year-end rally could set up 2025 for a bear market,…\n\n— Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 10, 2024\nCrypto Exchanges and Trading Activity\n\nThe price discovery process has intensified across major crypto exchanges, with:\n\nRecord high open interest\nStrong trading volumes\nDecreased volatility\nPositive price movements\nInstitutional Adoption\n\nBlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF has become a freight train of institutional inflows, suggesting that Bitcoin could reach new heights. The former president Donald Trump's victory has created a crypto-friendly environment, potentially easing regulatory concerns.\n\nThe upcoming $11.8 billion options expiry on December 27 is also expected to influence Bitcoin’s price movement. Analysts expect options market dynamics to add to Bitcoin’s volatility, as bulls and bears vie to shape the year-end outcome. Depending on market conditions, Bitcoin’s price could remain near $88,000 or surge above $90,000, leading to significant options-based adjustments.\n\nBTC options open interest for the year-end. Source: Laevitas\nPrice Movements Since Previous Halving\n\nThe blockchain data shows significant changes since the previous halving:\n\nNew bitcoins entering circulation at a reduced rate\nIncreased demand for Bitcoin\nGrowing institutional interest on Bitcoin\nPrice surge exceeding previous bull market cycles\nLennix Lai of OKX\n\nDespite warnings, sentiment in prediction markets remains largely optimistic for Bitcoin’s future. Lennix Lai of OKX sees potential for Bitcoin to surpass $100,000 by year-end.\n\n“The crypto market is showing signs of a paradigm shift, which could push BTC beyond 100k,” Lai commented.\n\nAccording to eToro analyst Josh Gilbert, the six-figure mark is within reach, given the combination of institutional demand and cooling interest rates.\n\nFuture Outlook and Market Sentiment\nLong-term Bullish Factors\n\nAmong investors, there's a strong consensus about Bitcoin potentially reaching the 100K mark before the end of this year. Views and opinions from leading analysts suggest several catalysts:\n\nInterest rate cut in September\nContinued ETF inflows into Bitcoin\nGrowing retail investors participation\nStrong positive sentiment in the U.S. market\n\nBen Simpson of Collective Shift and Mati Greenspan from Quantum Economics add to the bullish outlook, with both predicting sustained upward movement for Bitcoin.\n\n“Bitcoin’s limited supply and growing demand are key factors driving this bull run,” Simpson noted, pointing out that Bitcoin’s limited supply has been a strong driver for institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nGreenspan sees the rally as a longer-term trend, with the potential to surpass prior cycles.\n\nBitcoin just hit another all time high.\n\nAre you tired of winning yet?!\n\n— Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) November 11, 2024\nPrice Action and Trading Dynamics\n\nThe current price action shows Bitcoin trading near all-time highs, with:\n\nMetric\n\n\t\n\nCurrent Status\n\n\t\n\nImpact\n\n\n\n\nTrading Volume\n\n\t\n\nRecord levels\n\n\t\n\nBullish\n\n\n\n\nETF Inflows\n\n\t\n\nSaw record numbers\n\n\t\n\nVery positive\n\n\n\n\nMarket Sentiment\n\n\t\n\nLong-term bullish\n\n\t\n\nSupporting growth\n\n\n\n\nPrice Discovery\n\n\t\n\nActive\n\n\t\n\nFavorable\n\nPredictions for Bitcoin’s future range from conservative forecasts of $80,000 to highly optimistic targets of $100,000 or more. Analysts remain focused on Bitcoin ETFs, institutional inflows, and market dynamics as key factors contributing to Bitcoin’s potential. Tom Wan, an independent analyst, echoes this view, noting that favorable regulation and inflows into Bitcoin could lift prices above $100,000.\n\nCryptocurrency Market Outlook\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency market appears poised for significant growth. Bitcoin's price movements have created a new asset class that could fuel further adoption. At the time of publication, market indicators suggest:\n\nSustained institutional demand\nEnhanced market maturity\nReduced volatility compared to 2021\nPositive price action across crypto exchanges\n\nThe consensus across the crypto industry is that Bitcoin’s price trajectory is robust, though subject to fluctuations. Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has witnessed multiple bull markets, with each halving cycle intensifying demand due to Bitcoin’s reduced issuance rate. This cycle, combined with the anticipated impact of Trump’s pro-crypto policies, appears to support higher price movements.\n\nConclusion: Can Bitcoin Reach and Hold $100K?\n\nWith strong positive sentiment and increasing interest from institutional investors, Bitcoin’s year-end rally seems poised to reach new all-time highs. Yet, experts also warn of potential corrections, especially given high leverage and volatility.\n\nThe upcoming options expiry could shape Bitcoin’s price action as the year concludes, making the $100K milestone achievable yet challenging. As prediction markets indicate a bullish long-term outlook, Bitcoin’s path to $100K hinges on the balance between institutional support and market stability, marking 2024 as a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency market.\n\nBitcoin Price, FAQ\nHow high can Bitcoin realistically go?\n\nBitcoin’s price potential is influenced by several factors, including institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Realistic estimates by analysts suggest that, under favorable economic conditions and continued adoption, Bitcoin could reach between $100,000 and $500,000 in the coming years. The cryptocurrency’s fixed supply and increasing acceptance as a “digital gold” contribute to predictions of significant long-term growth, though extreme highs remain speculative and depend on global economic and market shifts.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin be worth in 2030?\n\nBy 2030, Bitcoin’s value is projected by some analysts to be in the range of $250,000 to over $1 million. This range is based on assumptions that institutional investors, corporations, and even governments may increasingly adopt Bitcoin as an asset. However, high volatility and regulatory uncertainties remain key factors that could influence its price trajectory over the decade.\n\nWill Bitcoin reach 100K in 2025?\n\nMany experts believe Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by 2025, as recent halving cycles, growing institutional interest, and potential favorable regulations could support this target. While some analysts are optimistic about reaching this level within the next year or two, others caution that volatility and market corrections could delay the timeline.\n\nHow high will Bitcoin go in 2050?\n\nPredicting Bitcoin’s price in 2050 involves a high degree of uncertainty. However, assuming continued global adoption and fixed supply, long-term forecasts suggest it could reach between $500,000 and several million dollars. If Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a digital asset class and experiences growing demand, it may achieve such values, though this remains speculative and contingent on broader economic and technological changes."

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nBY  WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS\nUpdated 3:47 AM GMT+5, November 13, 2024\nShare\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump’s reelection last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.\n\nThe world’s largest cryptocurrency topped $89,000 for the first time, briefly peaking at $89,995 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin’s price oscillated throughout the day, but is still up more than 27% over the last week — standing at about $88,288 as of 5 p.m. ET.\n\nThat’s part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated “crypto-friendly” nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.\n\nStill, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nBack up. What is cryptocurrency again?\n\nCryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.\n\nIn basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority — meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution — and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money — but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.\n\nWhy are bitcoin and other crypto assets soaring now?\n\nA lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of last week’s election.\n\nTrump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year’s presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nCrypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.\n\n“Crypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,” Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being “crypto-friendly” and a potential shift in regulatory backing.\n\nBut even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January.\n\nInflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, “have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,” Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.\n\nIn April, bitcoin also saw its fourth “halving” — a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. When that reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. And, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this “supply shock” can also help propel the price long term.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nCrypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value — which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.\n\nIn short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you’ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.\n\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.\n\nAt the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool — and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.\n\n“Investors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. “Because we’ve seen these wild swings in the past.”\n\nWhat about the climate impact?\n\nAssets like bitcoin are produced through a process called “mining,” which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.\n\nRecent research published by the United Nations University and Earth’s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin’s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).\n\nIn the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has “grown very rapidly over the last several years,” adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.\n\nEnvironmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.\n\n_________\n\nAP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report from London.\n\nWYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS\nGrantham-Philips is a business reporter who covers trending news for The Associated Press.

The price has more than doubled from about $37,000 12 months ago.\n\nThe election has also affected traditional currency markets, individual stocks – most notably Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla – and broad US equity markets, as investors bet on deregulation and tax cuts from Trump.\n\nTrump has in the past called bitcoin a “scam against the dollar”, but he changed his tune on cryptocurrency during the US presidential election campaign, courting the crypto community and appearing at industry events. That has created an expectation of a relaxation of rules to make it easier for retail savers to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – although Trump has not specified any policies.\n\nTrump reportedly picks China critic Mike Waltz as national security adviser – as it happened\nRead more\n\nThe Trump trade has spread throughout the world’s markets since his victory became clear, with the dollar gaining in value as investors await a high-spending US government.\n\nThe dollar rose by 0.6% on Monday against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, with the euro dropping to its lowest since May. One euro bought less than $1.06 on Monday, compared with $1.12 at the end of September. The pound also fell by 0.4% against the dollar, to trade below $1.29, close to its lowest level since August.\n\nIn China investors are bracing for steep new tariffs. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped by 1.5% on Monday, which some investors said represented an underwhelming response to China’s economic stimulus programme, announced last week.\n\nWhile the debt swap programme, aimed at shoring up local government finances, was worth about 10tn yuan (£1.1tn), economists at Deutsche Bank said that it “disappointed market expectations as it lacked direct fiscal stimulus and targeted measures to improve the housing market”.\n\nPrices have also risen since the election for other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and dogecoin, a meme coin previously backed by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and owner of X who has become a vocal Trump supporter and whose wealth rose by $26.5bn shortly after the election result was confirmed.\n\nTesla’s share price rose by almost 9% as investors hoped for the government to let carmakers accelerate autonomous car technology. Dan Ives, a prominent tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he believed that the “Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years”.\n\nMusk is not the only crypto backer with Trump’s ear. Trump even went as far as giving his backing in September to a cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, run by his family, a move that could leave him open to criticisms over potential conflicts of interest if he moves to deregulate digital assets.

The crypto exchange Coinbase has jumped by 40% since the election result, and its share price was up by another 20%. Microstrategy, a software company whose founder led huge purchases of bitcoin, was up 26%.\n\nMatt Simpson, a senior market analyst at City Index, described the moves on crypto markets as a “Trump pump” as traders bet that the president-elect will usher in a period of cryptocurrency adoption.\n\nThe price of bitcoin correlated to Trump’s vote share in opinion polls during the election campaign against the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. It was below $70,000 on election day last Tuesday, but has gained nearly a fifth in value since then. Some market watchers believe the price could top $100,000 this week.\n\nExplore more on these topics\nBitcoin\nCryptocurrencies\nDonald Trump\nUS economy\nEconomics\nE-commerce\nnews\nShare\nReuse this content"

What's behind the rally and will it continue?\nThe recent rally in Bitcoin, now nearing $90,000, comes on the back of Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance following his recent election victory in the US.\n\nListen to Story\n\nShare\nADVERTISEMENT\nBitcoin price is likely to touch $90,000 soon.\nIndia Today Business Desk\nNew Delhi,UPDATED: Nov 12, 2024 11:14 IST\nWritten By: Koustav Das\nIn Short\nBitcoin hits record high, fuelled by pro-crypto regulatory optimism\nDonald Trump’s crypto-friendly promises drive investor confidence in Bitcoin\nBitcoin's rally has also provided a boost to other cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin has pushed to a new record, reaching an all-time high of over $89,000 on Tuesday, as optimism around favourable regulatory changes and growing institutional interest fuel the surge. The recent rally in Bitcoin, now nearing $90,000, comes on the back of Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance following his recent election victory in the US.\n\nTrump has vowed to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet,” promising supportive policies, including the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. These pledges have boosted investor confidence, with analysts eyeing Bitcoin’s next major target of $100,000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMarket analysts attribute this surge to a mix of macroeconomic trends and recent policy developments. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s 25 basis points rate cut in November has directed investor sentiment toward alternative assets like Bitcoin.\n\n\"If history is any guide, Bitcoin could easily finish the year around $100,000,\" noted Kyle Rodda, a senior financial analyst at Capital.com. The rate cut signals an accommodative approach, easing inflation concerns and making Bitcoin more attractive as a hedge.\n\nBitcoin ETFs have also contributed significantly to its recent gains. Approval of these ETFs earlier this year has allowed institutional investors easier, regulated access to Bitcoin, expanding demand.\n\nEdul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, called the ETF approval a “game-changer,” adding that rate cuts in major economies have also increased cash flow into alternatives like Bitcoin.\n\nHimanshu Maradiya, Founder of CIFDAQ, said the Fed’s rate cut has catalyzed this shift in sentiment, as investors seek out Bitcoin’s unique qualities of scarcity and decentralization.\n\nMeanwhile, Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, pointed to Bitcoin’s $81,000 milestone and $1.5 trillion market cap as indicators of rising optimism. He highlighted growing interest from institutions and the role of Bitcoin ETFs in marking the end of the “crypto winter.”\n\n(Disclaimer: The views, opinions, recommendations, and suggestions expressed by experts/brokerages in this article are their own and do not reflect the views of the India Today Group. It is advisable to consult a qualified broker or financial advisor before making any actual investment or trading choices.)\n\nThe BTC fear-greed index, now showing “Extreme Greed,” reflects strong investor sentiment, with $2.8 billion in Bitcoin futures betting on the cryptocurrency crossing $90,000. This rally has also lifted other digital assets like Ethereum, which hit $3,200, underscoring Bitcoin’s impact across the broader cryptocurrency market\n\nPublished By:\nKoustav Das\nPublished On:\nNov 12, 2024\nMUST WATCH\nWatch Live TV\nFollow Us On:\nTRENDING TOPICS\nKanguva Movie Review\nSukhbir Badal\nDelhi NCR Pollution\nWho is Tulsi Gabbard\nPriyank Kharge\nDelhi Air Pollution\nLATEST\nNiva Bupa Share Price\nDOWNLOAD APP\nABOUT US\nCONTACT US\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nARCHIVES\nCopyright © 2024 Living Media India Limited.

24-hour trading volume of $117.64B. Over the last 24 hours, the price has decreased by -3.88%. Bitcoin currently has a circulating supply of 19.78M and a market cap of $1.76T.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency – a type of digital asset that uses public-key cryptography to record, sign and send transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain – all done without the oversight of a central authority.\n\nThe Bitcoin network (with an upper-case “B”) was launched in January 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers under the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto.” The network is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that uses a cryptocurrency called bitcoin (lower case “b”) to transfer value over the internet or act as a store of value like gold and silver.\n\nEach bitcoin is made up of 100 million satoshis (the smallest units of bitcoin), making individual bitcoin divisible up to eight decimal places. That means anyone can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with as little as one U.S. dollar.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price\n\nBitcoin’s price is renowned for being highly volatile, but despite that, it has become the top performing asset of any class (including stocks, commodities and bonds) over the past decade – climbing a staggering 9,000,000% between 2010 and 2020.\n\nWhen the cryptocurrency was launched at the beginning of 2009, as Satoshi Nakamoto mined the bitcoin genesis block (the first-ever block on the Bitcoin blockchain), 50 BTC entered circulation at a price of $0.00.\n\nFifty bitcoin continued to enter circulation every block (created once every 10 minutes) until the first halving event took place in November 2012 (see below). Halvings refer to bitcoin’s issuance system, which was programmed into Bitcoin’s code by Satoshi Nakamoto. It essentially involves automatically halving the number of new BTC entering circulation every 210,000 blocks.\n\nIn February 2011, BTC’s price reached parity with the U.S dollar for the first time. The milestone encouraged new investors into the market, and over the next four months, bitcoin’s price in USD continued to rise – peaking at over $30.\n\nBy early 2013, the leading cryptocurrency had recovered from a prolonged bearish episode and rose above $1,000, albeit only briefly. But with the infamous Mt Gox hack, China announcing its first ban on crypto and other situations, it took a further four years for the BTC price to return to above $1,000 again. Once that level was passed, however, bitcoin’s price continued to surge dramatically throughout 2017 until BTC peaked at its previous long-standing all-time high of $19,850.\n\nOver 2018, the entire crypto market plunged into what is now known as the “crypto winter” – a yearlong bear market. It wasn’t until December 2020, when bitcoin returned to test the previous all-time high, that it eventually surpassed that historical level and rose a further 239% over the next 119 days to a new all-time high of $64,799.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nHow does Bitcoin work?\n\nWho created Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin’s energy consumption\n\nManagement\n\nFLASH HEADLINE\n20:52:40\nBitcoin Extends Daily Loss to 5%, Dipping to $88k; Ether Lower by 7%\n20:00:19\nBarkin: Uncertainty Is One Reason to Be Cautious About Declaring Victory over Inflation\n19:58:25\nFed's Barkin: Last 30 Years Conducive to Low Inflation; Next Ten Maybe More Inflationary\n19:47:24\nBitcoin Quickly Falls 3% to $89.2k\n18:33:45\nBitcoin Edges Lower to $90.8k Following Slightly Hotter than Expected Ppi Data\n18:32:03\nU.s.

    "content": "NEWS CRYPTOCURRENCY NEWS\nWatch These Bitcoin Price Levels as Post-Election Rally Propels It Toward $90K\nBy TIMOTHY SMITH Published November 12, 2024 12:39 PM EST\nSource: TradingView.com.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nBitcoin remains in the spotlight on Tuesday as the cryptocurrency nears $90,000 amid a post-election rally. Investors are optimistic that the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers could provide regulatory clarity for digital assets and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.\nThe cryptocurrency's price has continued to trend sharply higher into price discovery mode after breaking out from a trading range last week following the election outcome.\nA bars pattern, which takes the Bitcoin's trending move from September 2023 to March this year and repositions it from the September 2024 low, projects an upside price target of around $150,000.\nInvestors should watch a crucial zone of support on the cryptocurrency's chart between $73,000 and $70,000.\n\nBitcoin (BTCUSD) remains in the spotlight on Tuesday as the pioneer cryptocurrency nears the $90,000 level for the first time.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has gained about 25% over the past week, hitting a series of record highs, amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration and Republican lawmakers could provide regulatory clarity for digital assets and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.\n\nA key demand driver continues to come from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which recorded net inflows of $1.2 billion on Monday, their second largest daily haul since launching in early January.\n1\n\nBitcoin was around $87,800 in early-afternoon trading Tuesday, after rising to just under $90,000 in overnight trading. The cryptocurrency surpassed $80,000 for the first time on Sunday.\n\nBelow, we break down the technicals on Bitcoin’s chart and identify important price levels to watch out for.\n\nTrading Range Breakout\n\nSince breaking out from an eight-moth trading range last week following the election outcome, Bitcoin’s price has continued to trend sharply higher on above-average volume into price discovery mode.\n\nIn another win for the bulls, the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-day MA late last month to form a golden cross, a bullish chart pattern that signals a new uptrend.\n\nMoreover, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms strong price momentum with a value above 80, though the elevated reading also indicates extremely overbought conditions that could lead to short-term profit taking.\n\nLet’s use technical analysis to predict how Bitcoin’s recent move higher may play out and also identify a crucial zone of support that could gain attention during retracements.\n\nBar Pattern Upside Price Target\n\nTo forecast a potential upside price target, we can use a bars pattern, a technique that analyzes prior trends to predict future directional moves, assuming that price action tends to rhyme.\n\nWhen applying the tool to Bitcoin’s chart, we take the cryptocurrency’s trending move from September 2023 to March this year and reposition it from the September 2024 low. This projects an upside target of around $150,000, an area that sits about 70% above Bitcoin’s current price.\n\nThe technique also provides clues to how long the current trend may continue. For instance, the prior trend played out over 183 trading days, meaning that a similar move may last until early March next year.\n\nWe selected the earlier trend because it commenced from the lower level of an established trading range, similar to how the cryptocurrency’s current move higher started.\n\nCrucial Zone of Support to Watch\n\nDuring retracements, investors should monitor a crucial zone of support between $73,000 and $70,000. This location on Bitcoin’s chart could attract buying interest near multiple trading levels positioned around trading range’s top trendline, a region that may flip from prior resistance into future support.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin ushered in the age of cryptocurrency, but it took quite a while before the public sat up and took notice.\n\nStill, in little more than a decade, cryptocurrency, and in particular, Bitcoin, has become one of the most exciting trading opportunities in a long time. Bitcoin trading has created millionaires, though given that persistent rise since its debut, plenty of traders would have done fine just holding – or HODLing – on for the ride, as many long-term bullish owners have done.\n\nDespite the long-term rise, Bitcoin has been dogged by periods where it’s fallen precipitously. The most recent has been from November 2021 through 2022, when the prospect of rising interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets sent Bitcoin’s price much lower.\n\nBitcoin was unleashed in the months after the global financial crisis obliterated economies. It was created by a mysterious individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, and early proponents touted the currency’s promise of moving monetary policy out of the hands of governments and central banks and into an autonomously managed system.\n\nBitcoin famously has a maximum of 21 million coins that can ever be created. In the face of this fixed supply, an ever-increasing demand can send the cryptocurrency soaring. Given these dynamics, speculators have rushed into the space to take advantage of the anticipated price appreciation.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is notoriously driven by sentiment. When the market shifts to its “greed” phase, Bitcoin soars amid the utopian promises and speculators dismiss the risks of an asset that generates no cash flow. In the “fear” phase, Bitcoin’s price seems to find no traction, as sellers push its price lower amid bad news or general market malaise.\n\nAmid all of this speculation, however, it’s important to remember that Bitcoin is tough to use for everyday purchases. Major companies that introduced ways to pay with Bitcoin have quietly walked back those initiatives. Now the market has rewritten the narrative from Bitcoin as a medium of exchange to one where it’s a store of value, “digital gold.” However, gold has a few thousand years of history as a store of value, compared to little more than a dozen for Bitcoin.\n\nHere’s how the price of Bitcoin has risen and fallen over time as well as some of the trends driving those moves.\n\nJanuary 2009 – July 2013: Bitcoin is created and attracts techies\n\nThe New Liberty Standard Exchange recorded the first exchange of Bitcoin for dollars in late 2009. Users on the BitcoinTalk forum traded 5,050 bitcoins for $5.02 via PayPal, making the first price mediated through an exchange a bargain basement price of $0.00099 per bitcoin. In other words, the price was about one-tenth of one cent.\n\nWhile Bitcoin was officially launched on January 3, 2009, it’s tough to find any standard pricing before mid-2010. That’s because there weren’t exchanges in the same way that there are today. However, data became available in July 2010 and continues to this day.\n\nIt was in 2010 that the most expensive pizzas of all time were purchased. One Bitcoin owner offered 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas, an offer that continues to live on in Bitcoin lore. It’s considered the first time that anyone used virtual currency to buy something in the real world.\n\nAccording to historical data at Investing.com, Bitcoin’s price never broke above $0.40 per bitcoin in 2010 but did manage to hit that level in early 2011. Then in February, it crossed $1. Just a few months later, in May, it briefly exceeded $8 – a stunning 8-bagger in mere months!\n\nBy June 2011, Bitcoin’s price had hit nearly $30, a seemingly unimaginable rise from just months before. And that’s where it topped out for the year. Bitcoin spent the remainder of 2011 just dwindling to as low as $2, before finishing the year at $4.70. After this bubble burst and a more than 90 percent fall from its all-time high, it might have seemed as if the Bitcoin fad was over.\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin spent much of the year consolidating, slowly growing stronger throughout the year. In November 2012, Bitcoin went through its first “halving,” a change in the reward structure for miners, where they receive half as many bitcoins for mining blocks on the blockchain. As 2012 came to an end, Bitcoin finished at $13.50, just off the highs for the year.\n\nThat consolidation set up Bitcoin for a strong run in 2013 when it began to attract more notice outside a niche audience of techies and hobbyists. The world’s first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver, allowing buyers to change fiat money for crypto. By the end of January, Bitcoin’s price had already risen to more than $20. The momentum built from there, as interest spread.\n\nBy early March, Bitcoin had already doubled again, rising to more than $40. A couple of weeks later it surpassed $50, and then days later $60. It climbed to $70 the day after that. By the start of April 2013, Bitcoin had passed $100 in breathtaking fashion. Then eight days later it spiked to $230!\n\nFrom there, it was just a week until Bitcoin was back at $68, as the bottom fell out. But then a week later, it had doubled again and traded north of $150. After the strong trading action in April and May, Bitcoin spent June and July settling down. Surely this was the peak of insanity for Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAugust 2013 – December 2017: Bitcoin breaks through to popular consciousness\n\nAfter months of consolidating from its rise earlier in the year, Bitcoin reached new heights in November 2013. Priced at $213 entering the month, Bitcoin doubled to nearly $435 just 12 days later. By the end of the month, it had nearly tripled from there, up to more than $1,200, before ending the year at $805, a real downdraft, but still up from just $541 a couple of weeks before. Late in the year, the People’s Bank of China banned financial institutions from using bitcoins.\n\nThe year 2014 saw Bitcoin retain its signature volatility. After hitting $1,000 in early January, Bitcoin bottomed at $111.60 on Feb. 21 – a decline approaching 90 percent! Behind the turbulence were problems at Mt. Gox, one of the earliest crypto exchanges. The exchange had stopped withdrawals, then filed for bankruptcy after losing 744,400 bitcoins of users’ funds.\n\nThen a mere five days later, Bitcoin recorded a price of $593.10 – more than a 5-bagger in days! Bitcoin spent the rest of the year gradually declining and closed 2014 at about $318.\n\nThe year 2015 started with Bitcoin declining, but most of the year was a slow uptrend, unusual for Bitcoin, and it ended the year at $430. In November, the official Bitcoin B symbol was adopted.\n\nThe first half of 2016 continued the same, with relatively muted volatility and price consolidation. But by the end of May, the price was picking up and by mid-June, Bitcoin was hitting $700. It didn’t last, though, and Bitcoin was back in the $600s until November 2016. It peaked back over $700 and then quickly $800 and $900. As the year ended, Bitcoin was flirting with $1,000, a level it broke through in early 2017, a watershed year for Bitcoin when it came to national awareness.\n\nThe year 2017 started off slowly enough, with Bitcoin wavering between $1,000 and $1,200. But by late April, the digital currency was clearly moving higher. The end of May saw Bitcoin at $2,300, but despite a move higher, it was back below $2,000 by mid-July. The decline didn’t last. By mid-August, Bitcoin had powered through $4,000 and then much higher. Retail traders were suddenly aware of the cryptocurrency and were driving volumes and prices higher.\n\nIn September, Bitcoin consolidated around $4,000 before moving decisively higher to $5,000 and then $6,000 in mid-October. The price of $7,000 was breached on Nov. 2, and then Bitcoin spent the rest of the year melting up: A couple of weeks later Bitcoin passed $8,000, then $10,000, surging to $13,000 days later, eclipsing $16,000 and by mid-December topping out above $19,000.\n\nIn December, Bitcoin futures began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, helping drive further interest and dollars to the cryptocurrency.\n\nIt was a perilously quick rise for Bitcoin that became self-sustaining. As the news spread, more people rushed in to buy, sending the price seemingly ever higher. But Bitcoin finished the year off its highest levels, ending the breakthrough year of 2017 at $13,850.\n\nJanuary 2018 – December 2020: Bitcoin recovers and soars even higher\n\nAfter the huge melt-up of 2017, Bitcoin spent most of 2018 in a downtrend, falling throughout the year, following a brief surge to start the year. By the end of the first quarter, Bitcoin was down nearly 50 percent from where it had started the year. It spent much of the year bouncing between $6,000 and $8,000 before closing 2018 at $3,709 – down 73 percent for the year.\n\nThe year 2019 kicked off with more of the same, as Bitcoin looked for direction. It tried to burst through $4,000 for the first few months, but finally hit it in April and then rose to $5,000. May came and Bitcoin reached $6,000, then $7,000, then $8,000 before settling back in early June. That month Bitcoin swiftly spiked to $13,000 before coming back.\n\nBy September, Bitcoin was back solidly under $10,000, and it continued to search for direction and fell until the end of the year, finishing out 2019 at just under $7,200.\n\nBut with the turn of the calendar to 2020, Bitcoin picked up, rising over the next six weeks to above $10,000. In the midst of the stock market downturns during the initial COVID pandemic wave, Bitcoin wavered, falling to $8,000. Then during the drawdown, it plummeted on March 12, 2020 – from $7,935 to $4,826 in a single day, a decline of more than 39 percent!\n\nBy early April, it was back above $7,000, then $8,000 and finally began pushing $10,000 in May. After dawdling for a couple of months, it finally rose to more than $11,000 in July and $12,000 in August. It settled over the next few months, until October, when it pushed through $13,000 again and ultimately vaulted to nearly $20,000 in November 2020, as financial markets tore higher on liquidity from the Federal Reserve and the prospect of a COVID vaccine.\n\nBitcoin raced higher during December 2020 and closed out the year at $28,949.\n\nJanuary 2021 – December 2023: Bitcoin gets pressured\n\nAfter what can only be described as a thrilling end of 2020 for Bitcoin, the digital currency started 2021 with a bang. The cryptocurrency climbed to start the year, peaking above $64,000 by mid-April, following a strong first quarter. Promises of seemingly never-ending liquidity from the Federal Reserve gave markets – both crypto and stocks – unbridled optimism.\n\nAfter this auspicious start to the year, there seemed to be only one place to go: down. In May, China warned cryptocurrency buyers that it was going to put pressure on the industry, and the price of Bitcoin began to drop. The country also announced that it was prohibiting financial institutions and payment platforms from transacting in cryptocurrency.\n\nThis news helped throw Bitcoin into a tailspin, where it quickly lost more than 50 percent of its value within a few months.\n\nLater, in September, China announced that all cryptocurrency transactions were illegal and that even foreign websites offering such services to Chinese traders were prohibited. The market shrugged off that news, and by October the currency was back over $60,000 and on its way to a new all-time high, at $68,789, on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nLate in 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin to taper its bond purchases, slowly draining liquidity from financial markets. With inflation roaring at multi-decade highs, the central bank wanted to tamp down rising prices. The 10-year Treasury rate began to rise, as investors began pricing in the prospect that the Fed would raise interest rates in the near future.\n\nThe prospect of less liquidity in the market threw risky assets such as high-growth stocks for a loop, and cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin followed along, starting in early November.\n\nThat malaise continued into 2022, as rising inflation and a central bank intent on raising rates to thwart it, drove investors from risky assets. Bitcoin bounced around the $40,000 mark for months, but as the Fed started to aggressively raise interest rates in March, it began to sink. In mid-2022, Bitcoin established a new trading range of around $20,000 but then sank to less than $16,000 as high-profile blow-ups such as FTX hurt traders’ confidence.\n\nThe price picked up in 2023, gaining more than 50 percent through mid-June, amid a broader rally in tech stocks. Bitcoin traded for around $26,000 as of mid-June 2023 despite a crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the crypto industry. It bounced around but was still near $27,000 by late September, before it began to break higher to end the year.\n\nAs interest rates seemed to be peaking in October 2023, Bitcoin started rising again. It ran to more than $42,000 to close out the year, amid rumors that the SEC would finally allow the creation of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nJanuary 2024 – November 2024: Bitcoin ETFs debut, Trump reelected\n\nAfter some months of speculation, the SEC officially permitted Bitcoin to be traded in an ETF, and 11 fund managers were allowed to list funds. Bitcoin ETFs then began trading on Jan. 11, 2024. Bitcoin peaked at nearly $49,000 in the days leading up to the announcement, but cooled somewhat in the weeks following.\n\nMoney has poured into the newly created Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, pushing the price of Bitcoin to a new all-time high above $73,000 in March. The summer months saw the price of Bitcoin retreat, trading mostly in the $60,000 range and falling below $55,000 in September. \n\nIn November, the price of Bitcoin soared to new highs, topping $90,000 for the first time, following the election victory of crypto-friendly former President Donald Trump.\n\nBitcoin returns by year\nYear\tReturn\n2009\tN/A\n2010\t30,203%*\n2011\t1,467%\n2012\t187%\n2013\t5,870%\n2014\t-61%\n2015\t35%\n2016\t124%\n2017\t1,338%\n2018\t-73%\n2019\t94%\n2020\t302%\n2021\t60%\n2022\t-64%\n2023\t156%\n2024 (YTD)\t109%\n* Based on 2009 price from New Liberty Standard ExchangeSource: Calculations based on data from Investing.com\n\n— Bankrate’s Brian Baker, CFA, contributed to an update of this article.\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.
